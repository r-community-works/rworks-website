Understanding this behavior may be helpful in constructing an informative prior for the multinomial distribution.\"\nimage: \"anim2.gif\"\nimage-alt: \"Evolution of Dirichlet distribution\"\ncategories: \"\"\neditor: source\n---\n\n\n\n\nIn 1839, the gifted mathematician [Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Gustav_Lejeune_Dirichlet) was attached to the Philosophy department at the University of Berlin working for less than full pay even though he had become a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1832. At that time, to become a \"full professor\" at the university it was required that a candidate deliver a [*Habilitationsschrift*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habilitation#:~:text=Habilitation%20is%20the%20highest%20university,their%20field%20in%20its%20entirety.) lecture in Latin. Apparently, Dirichlet's facility with Latin wasn't up to the task, so like many proficient \"adjunct professors\" today, Dirichlet took a side gig to support his family. He taught math at a military school.  Anyway, I digress. It was about that time that Dirichlet began to work on a problem in celestial mechanics which involved this integral:\n \n\n$$\\quad I := \\iiint_{S_s} \\frac{dx\\, dy\\, dz}{\\rho^p}$$\n\nHere $(x,y,z) \\in R^3$ which is attracted to a point $(a,b,c)$ where $1/\\rho^p$ is the force of attraction $(1 < p <3)$ and $\\rho^2 := (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 + (z - c)^2$ is the Euclidean norm.\n\nAfter a supernaturally insightful series manipulations detailed by [Gupta and Richards](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1403524), Dirichlet arrived at the following integral \n\n\n$$\\int_{S_s} \\left(1 - \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 \\right)^{\\alpha - 1} x_1^{v_1} x_2^{v_2} \\cdots x_n^{v_n} \\, dx_1 dx_2 \\cdots dx_n = \\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha) \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1 + v_1}{2}\\right) \\cdots \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1 + v_n}{2}\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{n + v_1 + \\cdots + v_n}{2}\\right)}$$\nwhich you will recognize as the Beta function, the normalizing constant for the [Dirichlet distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution):\n\n$$f(x_1, \\dots, x_K; \\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_K) = \n\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{B}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha})} \n\\prod_{i=1}^{K} x_i^{\\alpha_i - 1}$$\n\nwith mean $E[X_i] = \\alpha_i / \\alpha_0$ and variance $Var[X_i] = \\frac{\\alpha_i (\\alpha_0 - \\alpha_i)}{\\alpha_0^2 (\\alpha_0 + 1)}$\n\nwhere\n\n$\\mathrm{B}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}) = \n\\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^{K} \\Gamma(\\alpha_i)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{K} \\alpha_i\\right)}$ and $\\alpha_0 = \\sum_{i=1}^{K} \\alpha_i$\n\nThe Dirichlet distribution is a multivariate generalization of the Beta distribution that is often used in Bayesian statistics as a prior distribution for categorical and multinomial distributions. I illustrated this use of the Dirichlet in a [previous post](https://rworks.dev/posts/simple-bayesian-model/) while constructing a Bayesian model for a three-state Markov chain. The Dirichlet distribution is remarkable in that it brings together 18th and 19th century work in analysis as exemplified by the Gamma, Beta and digamma functions with early 20th ideas from geometry and topology (the simplex) and modern Bayesian statistics.\n\n## The (2)-Simplex\n\nA simplex is a generalization of the notion of a triangle to multiple dimensions. Informally in K dimensions, a simplex is the simplest polygon that is the convex hull of its K vertices. The vectors that comprise the simplex must be non-negative and sum to 1. So, a simplex is a natural way to represent probabilities that sum to 1 in multidimensional spaces.\n\nThe support for the three dimensional Dirichlet distribution, the points on which the distribution is defined, is a (2)-simplex the triangular subset of a 2-dimensional plane intersecting the Euclidean axes at the points (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). (Orient the triangle in the interactive plot below so that the reference plane is on top and the tip is pointing downward and you will see how the axes line up.)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r

When all the $\\alpha_i < 1$ the density is concentrated at the vertices of the simplex, and when $\\alpha_i > 1$, the density is concentrated in the center of the simplex with most of the mass concentrated on a few values. \n\n## How the symetric Dirichlet distribution changes as $\\alpha$ changes\n\nThe following animation, which projects the above plot onto two dimensions, shows how the Dirichlet distribution changes as the common value of $\\alpha_i$, called the concentration parameter, moves systematically from (1,1,1), the uniform distribution, to (0.1,0.1,0.1).  \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Code for helper functions\"}\n# This function generates the data frame for the animation\ngenerate_dirichlet_animation_data <- function(alpha1_values, alpha2_values, alpha3_values, n_samples = 2000) {\n  library(MCMCpack)\n  \n  # Triangle vertices\n  v1 <- c(1, 0)\n  v2 <- c(0, 1)\n  v3 <- c(0, 0)\n  \n  # Projection function\n  project_to_triangle <- function(x1, x2, x3) {\n    x <- x1 * v1[1] + x2 * v2[1] + x3 * v3[1]\n    y <- x1 * v1[2] + x2 * v2[2] + x3 * v3[2]\n    data.frame(x = x, y = y)\n  }\n  \n  # Generate animation data\n  animation_data <- do.call(rbind, lapply(seq_along(alpha1_values), function(i) {\n    alpha <- c(alpha1_values[i], alpha2_values[i], alpha3_values[i])\n    samples <- rdirichlet(n_samples, alpha)\n    projected <- project_to_triangle(samples[,1], samples[,2], samples[,3])\n    projected$alpha1 <- alpha[1]\n    projected$alpha2 <- alpha[2]\n    projected$alpha3 <- alpha[3]\n    projected$frame <- i\n    projected\n  }))\n  \n  return(animation_data)\n}\n\n# This function creates the animated plot\nplot_dirichlet_evolution <- function(animation_data) {\n  library(ggplot2)\n  library(gganimate)\n  library(grid)  # for arrow units\n  \n  # Triangle vertices\n  v1 <- c(1, 0)\n  v2 <- c(0, 1)\n  v3 <- c(0, 0)\n  \n  # Label positions\n  label_df <- data.frame(\n    x = c(v1[1], v2[1], v3[1]),\n    y = c(v1[2], v2[2], v3[2]),\n    label = c(\"(1,0,0)\", \"(0,1,0)\", \"(0,0,1)\"),\n    nudge_x = c(-0.08, 0.1, 0),\n    nudge_y = c(0, 0, 0.08)\n  )\n  \n  # Triangle outline\n  triangle_df <- data.frame(\n    x = c(v1[1], v2[1], v3[1], v1[1]),\n    y = c(v1[2], v2[2], v3[2], v1[2])\n  )\n  \n  # Build plot\n  p_animation <- ggplot(animation_data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = 0.3, size = 0.8, color = \"steelblue\") +\n    geom_density_2d(color = \"red\", alpha = 0.7) +\n    geom_path(data = triangle_df, aes(x = x, y = y), color = \"black\", size = 1) +\n    annotate(\"segment\", x = 1, y = 0, xend = 0, yend = 1,\n             arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, \"cm\")),\n             color = \"darkgreen\", size = 1.2) +\n    xlim(0, 1) + ylim(0, 1) +\n    geom_text(data = label_df,\n              aes(x = x, y = y, label = label),\n              nudge_x = label_df$nudge_x,\n              nudge_y = label_df$nudge_y,\n              size = 4, fontface = \"bold\", color = \"black\") +\n    labs(\n      title = \"Dirichlet Prior Evolution\",\n      subtitle = \"\",\n      x = \"Projected X\",\n      y = \"Projected Y\",\n      caption = \"Transition from uniform to concentrated distribution\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(size = 16, hjust = 0.5),\n      plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5),\n      axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n      plot.caption = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5)\n    ) +\n    transition_states(frame,\n                      transition_length = 1,\n                      state_length = 2) +\n    ease_aes('sine-in-out')\n  \n  return(p_animation)\n}\n\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n#| code-fold: true\n#| code-summary: \"Animation Code\"\n#| \nset.seed(42)\n\n# Parameters\nalpha1_values <- seq(1, 0.1, by = -0.01)  # starts high, ends low\nalpha2_values <- seq(1, 0.1, by = -0.01)   # starts low, ends high\nalpha3_values <- seq(1, 0.1, by = -0.01)   # starts low, ends high\n\nanimation_data <- generate_dirichlet_animation_data(alpha1 = alpha1_values, \n                                                    alpha2 = alpha2_values, \n                                                    alpha3 = alpha3_values, \n                                                    n_samples = 2000)\n\nplot_dirichlet_evolution(animation_data)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.gif)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThese next two plots, the first and last frames of the animation, clearly show how the density moves from being uniformly distributed over the simplex to being concentrated at the vertices of the simplex. When modeling the development of a multi-state Markov chain, as I was doing in the post I alluded to above, it is common practice to select a uniform Dirichlet prior with $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = (1,1,1)$. However, if you believe that the process is likely to start off uniformly distributed among the states, then a prior with $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = (0.1,0.1,0.1)$ might be appropriate. If you had reason to believe that the process would start off concentrated on particular states, then you might explore using an asymmetric distribution by setting different values for the $\\alpha_i$. The code driving these animations might be helpful.\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\nggplot(subset(animation_data, frame == 1), aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, color = \"darkblue\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Initial Frame: Uniform Prior: alpha = (1,1,1)\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"10%\"}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\n  ggplot(subset(animation_data, frame == max(animation_data$frame)), aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, color = \"red\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Final Frame: Concetrated Prior: alpha = (.1,.1,.1)\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n::::\n\nThis concentration of density as $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ increases is very apparent in this next simulation as $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ moves from (0.1, 0.1, 0.1)  to (10.0, 10.0, 10.0).

For the Dirichlet distribution where \n$\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = (\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\dots, \\alpha_K)$ is the concentration parameter, differential entropy $H(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha})$ is given by:$\n\n$$H(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}) = \\log B(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}) + (\\alpha_0 - K) \\psi(\\alpha_0) - \\sum_{i=1}^{K} (\\alpha_i - 1) \\psi(\\alpha_i)$$\n\n\nwhere: $B(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha})$ is the  multivariate Beta function, $\\Gamma(\\cdot)$ is the Gamma function and $\\psi(\\cdot)$ is the digamma function: $\\psi(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\log \\Gamma(x)$.\n\nNote that differential entropy is defined for continuous probability distributions. It does not behave the same way as the Shannon entropy which is used for discrete distributions. Among other things, differential entropy can be negative, in not invariant under a change of variables, and may not conform to any intuition you may have developed about maximum entropy. The plot on the left below shows the behavior of the differential entropy for the symmetric Dirichlet distribution we have been considering as $\\alpha$ moves from (0.1, 0.1, 0.1) to (5.0, 5.0, 5.0). Note that the entropy keeps increasing beyond the point $\\alpha = 1$ which corresponds to the uniform distribution over the simplex.\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\n# Define the number of dimensions for the symmetric Dirichlet distribution\nn <- 3\n\n# Define a function to calculate the entropy of a symmetric Dirichlet distribution\ndirichlet_entropy <- function(alpha, n) {\n  # This formula is for a symmetric Dirichlet distribution\n  # where all parameters a_i are equal to alpha.\n  # The formula uses the digamma function (psi) and the log-gamma function (lgamma).\n  # H(alpha) = log(Beta(alpha)) + (n * alpha - n) * psi(n * alpha) - n * (alpha - 1) * psi(alpha)\n  # log(Beta(alpha)) = n * lgamma(alpha) - lgamma(n * alpha)\n  # The final formula is simplified for symmetric case.\n  \n  # lgamma(x) is the log-gamma function\n  # digamma(x) is the psi function, the first derivative of lgamma(x)\n  \n  entropy_val <- lgamma(n * alpha) - n * lgamma(alpha) +\n                 (n * alpha - n) * digamma(n * alpha) -\n                 n * (alpha - 1) * digamma(alpha)\n                 \n  return(entropy_val)\n}\n\n# Create a sequence of alpha values from 0.1 to 5\nalpha_values <- seq(0.1, 5, by = 0.01)\n\n# Calculate the entropy for each alpha value\nentropy_values <- sapply(alpha_values, dirichlet_entropy, n = n)\n\n# Create a data frame for plotting\nplot_data <- data.frame(alpha = alpha_values, entropy = entropy_values)\n\n# Plot the entropy values\nggplot(plot_data, aes(x = alpha, y = entropy)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2, color = \"steelblue\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Entropy of a Symmetric Dirichlet Distribution\",\n    subtitle = paste(\"for n =\", n, \"dimensions\"),\n    x = \"Alpha (Concentration Parameter)\",\n    y = \"Entropy\"\n  ) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 1, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\", size = 1) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1.1, y = max(entropy_values) * 0.9,\n           label = \"Alpha = 1 (Uniform Distribution)\",\n           color = \"red\", hjust = 0, size = 4) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"10%\"}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\nk <- seq(.1, 10, by = 0.1)\n\nmean_dir <- numeric(length(k))\nvar_dir <- numeric(length(k))\nfor (i in seq_along(k)) {\n  alpha <- k[i]\n  sum_alpha <- alpha * 3\n  mean_dir[i] <- alpha / sum_alpha\n  var_dir[i] <- (alpha * (sum_alpha - alpha)) / (sum_alpha^2 * (sum_alpha + 1))\n}\ndf <- data.frame(k = k, mean = mean_dir, variance = var_dir)\nggplot(df, aes(x = k, y = variance)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"blue\", size = 1) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Variance of Dirichlet Distribution vs Alpha Parameter\",\n    x = \"Alpha Parameter (k)\",\n    y = \"Variance\"\n  ) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\nThe plot on the right shows the variance of the Dirichlet distribution as a function increasing $\\alpha$.
