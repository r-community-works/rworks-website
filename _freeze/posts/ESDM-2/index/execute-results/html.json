(2012)](https://bcs.wiley.com/he-bcs/Books?action=index&bcsId=7268&itemId=047006109X). In this post, we continue our project to present `rjags` versions of the `WinBugs` models in the text by presenting the economic decision models from Chapter 3. note that to run the code below you must first install the `JAGS` program which is available from <http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/>, and the `rjags` package is available from <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rjags/index.html>.\n\n\nChapter 3 of the text explores the health economics decision of whether or not a healthcare system should adopt the practice of prophylactically administering an antibiotic to women who are about to give birth by Cesarean section. Two versions of a decision model are presented: a deterministic model and a stochastic model. The deterministic model lays out the decision framework and calculates the expected costs of the two options: administering the antibiotic or not. The stochastic model adds uncertainty to the decision framework by assigning probability distributions to the parameters in the deterministic model. The stochastic model is then used to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of the two options.\n\nNot that cost effectiveness decision frameworks in healthcare are  typically presented as a Cost-Utility analysis, conducted from a systems perspective that measures utility of medical effects in Quality Adjusted Life Years using ICERs *(Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio) = (Additional Costs) / (Additional Benefits)*.\n\nThe final decision often comes down to examining the equation: Net Benefit = Uλ - C where:\n\n-   U = Lifetime utility of intervention (usually measured in [QALYS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year))\n-   λ = money value attributed to a unit of health gain: i.e. the exchange rate\n-   C = lifetime cost\n\n\nThe following figure depicts the decision as a tree. The square node shows the decision (whether or not to administer the antibiotic) and the round nodes show the subsequent chance event of wound infection. The two branches represent the treatment group (trt) who receive the antibiotic and the control group (ctl), who do not. The probability that a patient in the control group gets a wound infection is p1. In the treated group we expect the probability of infection (p2) to be different from the control group. The four leaves of this tree show the costs associated with the four outcome categories. The leaf labels ('cost_wdpx', etc) will be variables in our models, where 'wd' means the surgical wound is infected, 'nwd' means it is not, and 'px' means the patient was prescribed the prophylactic antibiotic. The costs of the leaves will be weighted by the probabilities to compute the expected payoff of each alternative for the decision. To keep things simple for now we only consider monitary costs; later we will generalize for utility (QALYs)\n\n![](decision_tree.png){fig-alt=\"The decision tree.\"}\n\n\n## Setup R Libraries\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# libraries\nlibrary(coda, verbose=FALSE)\nlibrary(rjags, verbose = FALSE)      # coda.samples\nlibrary(jagsUI, verbose=FALSE)     # wrapper for rjags\nlibrary(mcmcplots)  # caterplot\nlibrary(tidyverse, verbose=FALSE)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\n\n# A couple of helper functions\n#| message: FALSE\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| echo: FALSE\n# functions\ncoda_sample_2_df <- function(my_coda_sample){\n  # Extract data from a coda sample into a dataframe\n  seq_along(my_coda_sample) %>% lapply(function(chain){\n    df <- my_coda_sample[[chain]] %>% as.matrix %>% as.data.frame\n    df['chain'] <- chain\n    df\n  }) %>% \n    bind_rows %>% \n    mutate(chain=factor(chain))\n}\n\nplot_densities_from_coda_df <- function(vars, coda_df){\n  # Make comparative density plots for the given variables\n  coda_df %>% \n    select(all_of(vars)) %>%\n    pivot_longer(cols=vars) %>% \n    ggplot(aes(x=value, col=name, fill=name)) + geom_density(alpha=0.6)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Deterministic Decision Analysis\n\nIn this section we will present a deterministic model of the problem that can be described by means of the following directed graph. Variables in blue on the right side if the diagram represent cost data (see the table in the section \"Resource Use and Cost Data\" below). The costs of the four leaves of our decision tree are computed from these values. A patient with an infected wound will have a different cost per day of care that a patient without a woud infection, and presumably a diferent length of stay in the hospital. In addition, the treatment group has costs associated with buying and administering multiple doses of the prophylactic antibiotic.\n\nThe variables `nc1` and `rc1` are the total number of Caesarean sections and wound infections in the health system making the decision. Since they do not yet use prophylactic antibiotics for thie operation, these values let us estimate the prevalence of wound infections in the untreated group (`p1`).\n\nThe green variables in the upper left (a through d) represent data from a clinical trial (see the table in the \"Clinical Data\" section below). Since the prevalence of wound infection in the hospitals where the study was done is different from that in the target health system, we need to compute the relative risk for treated vs. control patients in the study. This is just the proportion of patients getting an infection in the treatment group, divided by the proportion in the control group:\n\n\n![](deterministic.png){fig-alt=\"Deterministic DAG.\"}\n\n$$ Relative Risk = \\frac{a/(a+b)}{c/(c+d)}$$\nwhere:\n\n-   a is the number of women who received antibiotics and subsequently developed infections\n-   b is the number of women who received antibiotics who did not develop infections\n-   c is the number of women who received the placebo and subsequently became infected\n-   d is the number of women who received the placebo who did not become infected\n\n\nThe deterministic model presented in this section may be found on page 56 in section 3.4 of the text.\n\n## The Clinical Data\n\nThe data for the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics to reduce infection in women delivering by cesarean section comes from a study by [Bibi et al., (1994)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8051377/). \n\nThis code executes the model by simply computing the products and sums, and displays the results.

These are shown in red in the diagram below.\n\n\nThe cost of administering the drug is now randomly taken from a range, the length of stay estimates are described as Normal distributions with a given mean and precision, the prevalence of infection in the target health system is represented with a beta distribution parameterized using the same numbers as before, and the relative risk is modeled by a Normal distribution on the log scale. Variables computed from these stochastic variables are stochastic as well, so 'p2', 'cst.trt', and 'cst.ctl' are also red, and the outcome of all this 'diff.cost' is in turn estimated stochastically.\n\n![](stochastic.png){fig-alt=\"Stochastic Model DAG.\"}\n\n# Model with Distributions\n\nThe next step towards working our way up to a full Bayesian model is to assign probability distributions to the clinical variables for which there is uncertainty.

The decision is from the point of view of a public health system concerned with providing the best outcome for a population given their budgetary constraints. However, the framework and the methodology can easily be reframed for decisions to be made by other organizations and individuals.\n\nA truly elegant feature of this model is that the uncertainties in the model parameters supporting the clinical calculations are expressed as probability distributions which propagate through the decision tree to compute the expected costs and benefits of each alternative. This integrated treatment of uncertainty that is superior to models that are limited to using point estimates to drive the economic decisions.\n\n\n",
