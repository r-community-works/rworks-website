Source: Internet Archive\"\ncategories: \"Puzzle Corner\"\n---\n\n\n\nHere's another puzzle from Henry Dudeney's article \"The World's Best Puzzles,\" *The Strand Magazine*, December 1908.\nAccording to Dudeney, this puzzle is originally from *Problèmes plaisans et délectables qui se font par les nombres* (Pleasant and delectable number problems), by French mathematician [Claude Gaspar Bachet de Méziriac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Gaspar_Bachet_de_M%C3%A9ziriac) (1851-1636).[^1]\n\n[^1]: Among Bachet's accomplishments is a method of constructing magic squares, a way of solving indeterminate equations with continued fractions, the proof of [Bézout's Identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Gaspar_Bachet_de_M%C3%A9ziriac), and a Latin translation of *Arithmetica* by Diophantus (he of the Diophantine equations). Famously, Fermat's last theorem was a scribbled margin note on his copy of this very translation.\n\n![A balance scale and four weights.](four-weights.jpg){fig-alt=\"A balance scale and four weights. Source: Internet Archive\"}\n\n> You have four (integral) weights $w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4$ and a balance scale such that you can weigh any (integral) number of pounds from 1 lb to 40 lbs. The weights may go on either side of the scale (e.g., with the object or in the opposite pan). What are the $w_i$?\n\nThis seems like a variation on the [Frobenius coin problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin_problem), which, in general, is NP-hard. Fortunately, this specific instance is not.\n\nAs before, here's Chirico's *The Mathematicians* for you to look at while you try to solve this. Solution below.\n\n![The Mathematicians, Chirico (1917)](the-mathematicians-1917.jpg){fig-alt=\"The Mathematicians, Chirico (1917) source: WikiArt\"}\n\n## The Solution\n\nThe four weights are (1, 3, 9, 27). Before we confirm this computationally, let's compute the solution using induction.\n\nLet's rephrase the problem as \n\n> You have $n$ weights... such that you can weigh any number of pounds in the range `1:m`....\" \n\nwhere $m$ depends on how many weights you have. We can also observe that the sum of all the weights must equal the weight of the heaviest object you can measure, and that object must weigh $m$ pounds.\n\nThen, for the case $n = 1$, you have a single weight $w_1 = 1$, and you can weigh any object that weighs one pound (the interval 1:1). Now let's look at the case $n=2$.\n\n### 1. The weights $(w_1 = 1, w_2 = 3)$ can weigh any object from 1 to 4 pounds.\n\nI'll use $x$ to denote the object to be weighed, and the notation $[\\{set_1\\} | \\{set_2\\}]$ to denote what's on the left and the right side of the scale. I'll always put $x$ in the right-hand pan.\n\n**$x = 1$** is weighed as $[\\{1\\} | \\{x\\}]$. This can be written as $1 = x$.\n\n**$x = 2$** is weighed as $[\\{3\\} | \\{x, 1\\}]$. This can be written as $3 = x + 1$, or $3 - 1 = x$.\n\n**$x = 3$** is weighed as $[\\{3\\} | \\{x\\}]$. This can be written as $3 = x$.\n\n**$x = 4$** is weighed as $[\\{1, 3\\} | \\{x\\}]$. This can be written as $1 + 3 = x$.\n\nYou can see from the above that the general form of the solution is\n\n$$\ns_1 w_1 + s_2 w_2 = x\n$$\n\nwhere $(w_1, w_2) = (1, 3)$ and $s_1 \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. A positive coefficient means the weight is in the left pan, a negative one means it's in the right pan, and zero means the weight isn't used. This is essentially a \"signed trinary\" representation of $x$. For two digits, signed trinary can represent $3^2 = 9$ values.\n\nLet's just see what that looks like in R:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(poorman)\n\nsigns = c(-1, 0, 1)\n\nS = expand.grid (s1 = signs, s2 = signs)\n\nknitr::kable(S)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n| s1| s2|\n|--:|--:|\n| -1| -1|\n|  0| -1|\n|  1| -1|\n| -1|  0|\n|  0|  0|\n|  1|  0|\n| -1|  1|\n|  0|  1|\n|  1|  1|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nLet's take the linear combination of `s1` and `s2`, using the weights (1, 3).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nS = S |>\n  mutate(x = 1 * s1 + 3 * s2)\n\nknitr::kable(S)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n| s1| s2|  x|\n|--:|--:|--:|\n| -1| -1| -4|\n|  0| -1| -3|\n|  1| -1| -2|\n| -1|  0| -1|\n|  0|  0|  0|\n|  1|  0|  1|\n| -1|  1|  2|\n|  0|  1|  3|\n|  1|  1|  4|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nYou can confirm for yourself that using another pair of weights won't necessarily give you 9 unique values.\n\nWe are only interested in the positive values for our problem. We can calculate that the number of positive values is\n\n$$\n(3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4.\n$$\n\n\nIn other words, the weights (1, 3) can weigh the values `1:4`.\n\n### 2. The case of three weights\n\nHow many values can we weigh with three weights, and what are they? It's clear that $w_1$ and $w_2$ must be the same as above, since any value in the range `1:4` can be represented as $s_1 * 1 + s_2 * 3 + 0 * w_3$. Now to find $w_3$.\n\nWe know that $3^3 = 27$, which means that we can represent $(27 - 1)/2 = 13$ positive values, with 13 being the maximum.\nSo the three weights must sum to 13, which gives us $w_3 = 13 - (1 + 3) = 9$. The set of weights is (1, 3, 9).\n\n### 3. Finally, the case of four weights\n\nWe can calculate that $3^4 = 81$, which corresponds to $(81 - 1)/2 = 40$ positive values (surprise!). Therefore, we have that $w_4 = 40 - (1 + 3 + 9) = 27$. And so the set of weights we want is (1, 3, 9, 27), as stated above.\n\nNow, let's confirm it.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nS = expand.grid (s1 = signs,\n                 s2 = signs,\n                 s3 = signs,\n                 s4 = signs) |>\n  mutate(x = 1 * s1 + 3 * s2 + 9 * s3 + 27 * s4) |>\n  filter(x > 0)\n\n# confirm we have the values 1:40\nstopifnot(S$x == 1:40)\n\nknitr::kable(S)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|   | s1| s2| s3| s4|  x|\n|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|42 |  1|  0|  0|  0|  1|\n|43 | -1|  1|  0|  0|  2|\n|44 |  0|  1|  0|  0|  3|\n|45 |  1|  1|  0|  0|  4|\n|46 | -1| -1|  1|  0|  5|\n|47 |  0| -1|  1|  0|  6|\n|48 |  1| -1|  1|  0|  7|\n|49 | -1|  0|  1|  0|  8|\n|50 |  0|  0|  1|  0|  9|\n|51 |  1|  0|  1|  0| 10|\n|52 | -1|  1|  1|  0| 11|\n|53 |  0|  1|  1|  0| 12|\n|54 |  1|  1|  1|  0| 13|\n|55 | -1| -1| -1|  1| 14|\n|56 |  0| -1| -1|  1| 15|\n|57 |  1| -1| -1|  1| 16|\n|58 | -1|  0| -1|  1| 17|\n|59 |  0|  0| -1|  1| 18|\n|60 |  1|  0| -1|  1| 19|\n|61 | -1|  1| -1|  1| 20|\n|62 |  0|  1| -1|  1| 21|\n|63 |  1|  1| -1|  1| 22|\n|64 | -1| -1|  0|  1| 23|\n|65 |  0| -1|  0|  1| 24|\n|66 |  1| -1|  0|  1| 25|\n|67 | -1|  0|  0|  1| 26|\n|68 |  0|  0|  0|  1| 27|\n|69 |  1|  0|  0|  1| 28|\n|70 | -1|  1|  0|  1| 29|\n|71 |  0|  1|  0|  1| 30|\n|72 |  1|  1|  0|  1| 31|\n|73 | -1| -1|  1|  1| 32|\n|74 |  0| -1|  1|  1| 33|\n|75 |  1| -1|  1|  1| 34|\n|76 | -1|  0|  1|  1| 35|\n|77 |  0|  0|  1|  1| 36|\n|78 |  1|  0|  1|  1| 37|\n|79 | -1|  1|  1|  1| 38|\n|80 |  0|  1|  1|  1| 39|\n|81 |  1|  1|  1|  1| 40|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAnd we are done. At this point, I'll note that we've just re-invented a signed base-3 number system: digit $i$ (counting from zero) represents the value $3^i$. I just happened to be writing it backwards.",
