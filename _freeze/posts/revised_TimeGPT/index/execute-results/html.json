This post, a revision of the of the post first published on 2025-02-12, corrects an error that deleteriously affected the ARIMA and exponential smoothing forecasts which are contrasted with the TimeGPT forecast.\"\ncategories: \"\"\neditor: source\n---\n\n\nThis post is a first look at [Nixtla's](https://docs.nixtla.io/) `TimeGPT` generative, pre-trained transformer for time series forecasting using the `nixtlar` R package.\n\nAs described in [Garza et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04052), TimeGPT is a Transformer-based time series model with self-attention mechanisms. The architecture comprises an encoder-decoder structure with multiple layers, each with residual connections and layer normalization. The encoder, a stack of multi-head self-attention layers followed by a feed-forward neural network, processes the input time series. The decoder, which is similar to the encoder, generates the forecast. The decoder includes an additional multi-head attention layer that takes the encoder’s output as input. The model is trained using a teacher-forcing strategy, where the decoder receives the ground-truth values during training. The model is then used for forecasting by feeding the model’s predictions back as input during inference.\n\n![](timegpt.png){fig-alt=\"TimeGPT architecture\"}\n\n\nNixtla's website provides a considerable amount of explanatory material, documentation, and code examples in Python. The [`nixtlar`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=nixtlar) package wraps the Python code to provide an R interface. The package documentation for version 0.6.2 doesn't fully the R functions, but the vignettes provide sufficient code examples to get started.\n\n*Before getting started with TimeGPT, you will have to register for an API key. The process is easy enough and is described in this [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nixtlar/vignettes/setting-up-your-api-key.html).*\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(forecast)\nlibrary(prophet)\nlibrary(nixtlar)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## The Data\n\nThe electricity dataset included in the `nixtlar` package contains hourly observations of  electricity consumption generated sourced from the [PJM Interconnection LLC](https://www.pjm.com/), a regional transmission organization that is part of the Eastern Interconnection grid in the United States.

Note, I will not attempt any tuning of these models in an attempt to make it a fair, \"out-of-the-box\" comparison.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\nNF <- 24\n\nBE_df_wide <- df |> pivot_wider(names_from = unique_id, values_from = y) |>\n  select(ds, BE) |> drop_na()\n\nBE_train_df <- BE_df_wide %>% filter(row_number() <= n() - NF)\nBE_test_df <- tail(BE_df_wide, NF)\nBE_train_df <- BE_train_df |> rename(y = BE) |> mutate(unique_id = \"BE\")\nBE_test_df <- BE_test_df |> rename(y = BE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThe `nixtla_client_forecast()` function is the main `nixtlar` forecasting function.

Both of these functions require that the data be expressed as a `ts()` object. The original version of this post formatted the data as an `xts()` object: an error that substantially impacted the ARIMA and exponential smoothing forecasts. There is a problem though with using `ts()`: the electricity data has multiseasonal aspects which `ts()` was not designed to accommodate. The code below that creates the `ts()` object treats time as an index of days with a period of 24 and ignores all the rest of the seasonality information in the data set. This is clearly not a perfect solution, but it provides a workaround that is good enough for my purpose of comparing `TimeGPT` with a couple of very simple automatic forecasts. You will see below that ARIMA forecast is quite good.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\nauto_train <- BE_train_df |> select(-unique_id) |>\nmutate(time = 1:length(ds))|> select(-ds)\nelec_ts <- ts(auto_train$y, frequency = 24)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### ARIMA Forecast with `auto.arima()`\n\nThe `auto.arima()` function from the `forecast` package fits a fairly sophisticated ARIMA(2,1,1)(1.0.1)[24] model. The parameters in parentheses means two autoregressive terms, one difference, one moving average term, one seasonal autoregressive term, no seasonal differencing, and one seasonal moving average term. [24] indicates that the seasonal pattern repeats every 24 observations. (Note that because the ARIMA forecast takes several seconds to run, I am reading form a an rds file to expedite the blog process.)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\n#Run the following three lines to actually generate the forecast on your own.\n# arima_fcst <- elec_ts |>\n# auto.arima() |>\n# forecast(h = NF , level = 95)\n#saveRDS(arima_fcst, \"arima_fcst_24.rds\")\narima_fcst <- readRDS(\"arima_fcst_24.rds\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Exponential Smoothing Forecast with `ets()`\n\nBecause I have provided no guidance, the `ets()` function from the `forecast` package fits an ETS(M,N,M) model. This is a multiplicative model without a trend component, where both the error and the seasonal components are multiplicative. The first M indicates that the error term (random fluctuation) is modeled as a multiplicative component where the error term's effect on the forecasted value is proportional to the level of the time series.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\nets_fcst <- elec_ts |>\n  ets() |>\n  # number of periods to forecast\n  forecast(h = NF)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Prophet Forecast\n\nI also ask the `prophet()` function from the `prophet` package for an automatic fit using the default parameters. Among other things, this means a linear growth curve with additive seasonality and automatic estimates for daily seasonality. As for the `TimeGPT` forecast, the model is fit using`BE_train_df` data frame in which the time variable is character data. The `make_future_dataframe()` function creates a data frame with the same structure as `BE_train_df` but with the `ds` column extended by `NF` periods.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\nprophet_fit <- prophet(BE_train_df)\n\nfuture <- make_future_dataframe(\n  prophet_fit,\n  periods = NF,\n  freq = 3600,\n  include_history = FALSE\n)\n\nprophet_fcst <- predict(prophet_fit, future)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nBefore plotting, let's have a look at the wide data frame that holds the forecasts.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\nfcst_df2 <- fcst_df |>\n  mutate(\n    arima_fcst = as.vector(arima_fcst$mean),\n    ets_fcst = as.vector(ets_fcst$mean),\n    prophet_fcst = prophet_fcst$yhat\n  )\n\nhead(fcst_df2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n                 time tgpt_fcst elec_actual arima_fcst ets_fcst prophet_fcst\n1 2016-12-30 00:00:00  38.82010       44.30   46.19057 37.72396     32.05748\n2 2016-12-30 01:00:00  36.29234       44.30   44.99377 34.97583     29.74375\n3 2016-12-30 02:00:00  34.97838       41.26   44.06233 32.89185     22.66588\n4 2016-12-30 03:00:00  32.99565       40.62   42.45347 29.87591     15.85864\n5 2016-12-30 04:00:00  31.58322       40.07   43.05403 27.56602     15.62841\n6 2016-12-30 05:00:00  33.27422       41.02   44.28001 29.15387     23.54824\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThen, shape the data into long format and plot.\n\n::: {.cell .preview-image}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\nfcst_dft2_long <- fcst_df2 %>%\n  pivot_longer(!time, names_to = \"method\", values_to = \"mean\")\n\nq <- fcst_dft2_long |>\n  ggplot(aes(\n    x = time,\n    y = mean,\n    group = method,\n    color = method\n  )) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  ggtitle(\"TimeGPT vs ARIMA vs ETS vs Prophet vs actual data - 24 Point Forecast\")\n\nq\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe TimeGPT forecast looks quite good. I don't think this is a big surprise, given that the Nixtla folks chose the electricity data set to show off their transformer. However, it is curious, that except for one point, the TimeGPT forecast is lower than the actual data. It is also interesting that some of the forecasted points that are farther out are a better match to the actual data than the initial forecast points.\n\nThe ARIMA forecast is very good. It tracks the first few points very closely, undershoots the peaks of the actual data, but recovers after both peaks and tracks the data well towards the end of the forecast period. \n\nThe exponential smoothing forecast mostly stays well below the actual data, but also dose pretty well overall. \n\nThe black box prophet model overacts to the downward trends at the beginning and end of the forecast period. My guess is that with a little tuning prophet could do much better. \n\nIt is also worth noting that choosing the *best* forecast also depends on your objectives. For example, in some circumstances, one might prefer  a forecast that reproduces seasonal patterns or possible volatility rather than overall accuracy. For this exercise, we see that TimeGPT mimics the volatility of the actual data but that the ARIMA forecast has the lowest root mean squared error. Also note that the ARIMA and exponential smoothing forecasts are not quite *black-box* forecasts. In converting the data into `ts()` a time series object explicitly provided seasonality information. TimeGPT apparently inferred this information from character data.\n \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\nRMSE <-  function(m, o){sqrt(mean((m - o)^2))}\nrms_names <- c(\"tgpt\", \"arima\", \"ets\", \"prophet\")\nrms_fcst <- array(NA_real_,\n                          dim = 4,\n                          dimnames = list(rms_names))\nrms_fcst[1] <- RMSE(fcst_df2$tgpt_fcst, fcst_df2$elec_actual)\nrms_fcst[2] <- RMSE(fcst_df2$arima_fcst, fcst_df2$elec_actual)\nrms_fcst[3] <- RMSE(fcst_df2$ets_fcst, fcst_df2$elec_actual)\nrms_fcst[4] <- RMSE(fcst_df2$prophet_fcst, fcst_df2$elec_actual)\nrms_fcst\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n     tgpt     arima       ets   prophet \n 6.601752  4.966623  9.355767 14.948709 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Some Final Thoughts\n\n\nIt is clear that the TimeGPT model has upped the game for black-box time series forecasting. It is sure to become a powerful tool for exploratory work with large time series and for comparing  multiple time series. It may become the *go-to* baseline forecasting tool for a wide range of time series projects. Moreover, I expect that time series experts who can fine-tune prophet and more traditional time series models will be able to develop some intuition about what TimeGPT is doing by assessing its behavior in relation to these models. \n\nI am aware that this little post may have raised more questions than it answered. If so, please try your hand at elaborating on some of the issues raised. We would be very happy to consider your time series posts for publication on R Works.\n\nFinally, for a more sophisticated analysis of these series that deals with their multiseasonality aspects, see the [Electricity Load Forecast Tutorial](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/mlforecast/docs/tutorials/electricity_load_forecasting.html). And, for some ideas about how to harness \"ordinary\" LLMs for time series forecasting have a look at the second half of the talk that Bryan Lewis gave to [nyhackr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NM-nJxm-qY) in April 2024.\n\n\n## Acknowledgment\nMany thanks to Professor Rob Hyndman for flagging the ARIMA time series object error described above and for generously suggesting alternatives that led to the workaround described above. Any errors still remaining in this post are all mine.\n\n",
