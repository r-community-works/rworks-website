It is a reminder of the inherent identifiability problem of ARIMA models and a record of a couple of afternoons spent down this rabbit hole.\"\ncategories: \"\"\nimage: plot1.png\neditor: source\n---\n\n\nIn my previous post [A First Look at TimeGPT using nixtlar](https://rworks.dev/posts/revised_TimeGPT/), I used the `auto.arima()` function from the `forecast` package to fit an ARIMA model to a time series of electricity usage data in order to compare and ARIMA forecast with the `TimeGPT` forecast. While working out the bugs in that post, I also fit an automatic ARIMA model using the newer and improved `fable` package and was very surprised by the results. In this post, I will show what surprised me, work through my investigation, and present some practical consequences of the problem of ARIMA identifiability.\n\nHere are the necessary libraries and the data that we will be working with.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(forecast)\nlibrary(fable)\nlibrary(tsibble)\nlibrary(nixtlar) # for the electricity data\nlibrary(feasts)\nlibrary(Metrics)\n```\n:::\n\n\nAs in the `TimeGPT` post, I will use the BE electricity usage data set from the `nixtlar` package for fitting models and making forecasts.

Anyone who has ever tried to find a suitable ARIMA model by following the theory in the textbooks: looking at the ACF and PACF functions, etc., knows how fragile the process is. Indeed, the experts will tell you that the *identifiability* of ARIMA models is a well-known problem. Consider this note on page 305 from [Brockwell and Davis (1987)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4899-0004-3):\n\n*Of course, in the modelling of real data, there is rarely such a thing as the \"true order\". For the process $X_t =  \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\psi_jZ_{t-j}$  there may be many polynomials $\\theta(z)$, $\\phi(z)$ such that the coefficients of $z^j$ in $\\theta(z)/\\phi(z)$ closely approximate $\\psi_j$ for moderately small values of j. Correspondingly, there may be many ARMA processes with properties similar to {X,}. This problem of identifiability becomes much more serious for multivariate processes.*\n\n## Variations on a theme\n\nBecause the two nearly identical solutions to the problem of finding a model that adequately fits the data are essentially linear equations, I imagine that they live somewhere close to each other in some multidimensinal vector space. Are there other solutions nearby? Are there better solutions? Given that I have two solutions, it seems reasonable to assume that minor perturbations of the p,d,q,P,D,Q parameters may turn up additional models with similar AICc and RMSE profiles. These questions seem worthy of some further investigation.\n\nFiddling with the parameters mostly resulted in numerical errors of one sort or another or inferior solutions. But, I did find a third solution that is at least as good as the others. Notice that the AICc compares favorably with the other two models.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\nfable_fit_3 <- elec_ts_2  |>\nas_tsibble() |>\nmodel(F_013002 = ARIMA(y ~ 0 + pdq(0, 1, 3) + PDQ(0, 0, 2))) |>\nreport()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nSeries: y \nModel: ARIMA(0,1,3)(0,0,2)[24] \n\nCoefficients:\n          ma1      ma2      ma3    sma1    sma2\n      -0.5037  -0.2156  -0.0968  0.5082  0.1355\ns.e.   0.0246   0.0287   0.0252  0.0247  0.0226\n\nsigma^2 estimated as 722.2:  log likelihood=-7796.99\nAIC=15605.98   AICc=15606.03   BIC=15638.45\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd once again, we see that all of the ARIMA forecasts sit on top of each other.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\nfable_ARIMA_fcst_3 <- fable_fit_3 |> forecast(h = 24)\narima_fcst_df <- arima_fcst_df |> mutate(F_013002 =  as.vector(fable_ARIMA_fcst_3$.mean) )\ncompare_fore(arima_fcst_df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Are there better solutions?\n\nFor a final try to find a better forecast, I used the search feature of the fable::ARIMA function to systematically search through the model space constrained by p + q + P + Q <= 6 p + q + P + Q <= 6 & (constant + d + D <= 2).

Each provides a reasonably good fit based on comparing the RMSE of its forecast with the actual values of the hold-out test data. Because of the way that the automated ARIMA algorithms in the  `forecast` and `fable` time series packages search for solutions, it seems reasonable to assume that these solutions are somehow \"close\" to each other in the solution space inhabited by the stochastic difference equations that specify the models. A reasonable question is: are there better models that live somewhere else in the solution space? Answering this means figuring out a way to exploit the structure that may still be in the residuals, a quest I may pursue another day.\n",
