Introduction and recap\n\nHealthcare analytics offers significant benefits to a wide range of stakeholders, including health administrators, organizations, and most importantly, doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers.\n\nIn the first [part](https://rworks.dev/posts/healthcare-part1/) of this series, we introduced a complex dataset of diabetes patient encounters, comprising 100,000+ rows and over 50 columns. This dataset includes a rich array of variables, such as admission type and primary diagnosis. We demonstrated the process of cleaning, redefining, and preparing this data for analysis, highlighting the use of GitHub Copilot to navigate a particularly challenging variable.\n\nIn this second installment, we will dive deeper to evaluate the effectiveness of healthcare delivery and the impact of patient-level variables on downstream outcomes. We start by exploring medication prescriptions more closely and setting up the analytics around patient outcomes like hospital readmissions, the analysis of which we will see more in the next post.\n\nFinally, in a supplemental post that we will publish shortly after this one, we will examine the use of Copilot a little more, especially around avoiding tricky situations arising from insufficient context or guidance provided to Copilot (see here for [more](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/tools/copilot.html)).\n\n## 2. Some useful data summaries\n\nBefore we explore how downstream outcomes, such as early hospital readmissions, may be influenced by specific care delivery actions, such as whether a patient’s HbA1c was measured during their stay, let’s ground ourselves in the dataset. We’ll start by summarizing key variables, which include:\n\n-   **Covariates** — such as initial diagnoses and early interventions upon admission.\n\n-   **Outcomes** — both intermediate care delivery results and downstream events, like early readmissions.\n\nUnderstanding the structure and distribution of these variables is a critical first step before modeling or drawing any conclusions.\n\nLet's read in the data again and clean it.  The code [snippet](https://github.com/VidishaVac/healthcare-analytics/blob/main/cleanDiabetic_data.R) and the data can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/VidishaVac/healthcare-analytics/tree/main/dataset_diabetes). We will summarize the following fields, and instead of tables, we will use some compelling visuals to rapidly get us to our insights.\n\n| Field name | Field type | Field description |\n|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| `primary_diag` | initial admission covariate | primary diagnosis upon admission |\n| `a1c` | initial admission covariate | whether a patient was given the A1c test or not |\n| `diabetesMed` | intermediate response | whether a patient was given any diabetes medication |\n| `acarbose:troglitazone` | intermediate response\\*\\* | individual 23 diabetes medications that were prescribed or not, and if prescribed, were held steady, increased or decreased |\n| `readmitted` | final response | whether the patient was readmitted early (\\<30 days) |\n\n: Table 1: Important fields to be summarized, \\*\\*this will be summarized in the next section\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\n# --------------------------------------------- #\n# Load necessary libraries\n# --------------------------------------------- #\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\nlibrary(grid)\nlibrary(lattice)\n\n# --------------------------------------------- #\n# Read in the data\n# --------------------------------------------- #\n\nD <- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VidishaVac/healthcare-analytics/refs/heads/main/dataset_diabetes/diabetic_data.csv\", sep = \",\")\n\n# -------------------------------------------------------- #\n# Clean and re-define HbA1c and primary diag\n# -------------------------------------------------------- #\n\nD <- D %>%\n  mutate(\n    a1c = ifelse(A1Cresult == \"None\", \"not measured\", \"measured\"),\n    primary_diag = case_when(\n      diag_1 %in% c(390:459, 785) ~ \"Circulatory\",\n      diag_1 %in% c(460:519, 786) ~ \"Respiratory\",\n      diag_1 %in% c(520:579, 787) ~ \"Digestive\",\n      diag_1 %in% c(580:629, 788) ~ \"Genitourinary\",\n      diag_1 %in% c(630:679) ~ \"Pregnancy\",\n      diag_1 %in% c(680:709, 782) ~ \"Skin\",\n      diag_1 %in% c(710:739) ~ \"Musculoskeletal\",\n      diag_1 %in% c(740:759) ~ \"Congenital\",\n      diag_1 %in% c(800:999) ~ \"Injury\",\n      grepl(\"^250\", diag_1) ~ \"Diabetes\",\n      is.na(diag_1) ~ \"Missing\",\n      TRUE ~ \"Other\"\n    )\n  )\n\n# Remove columns not used, patients with a discharge disposition of \"expired\" or \"hospice\"\nD <- D %>% select(1,2,7:9,25:52) %>% \n  filter(!discharge_disposition_id %in% c('11','13','14','19','20','21'))\n\n# Summarize\nsummary_a1c <- D %>%\n  group_by(a1c) %>%\n  summarise(count = n(), percent = n() / nrow(D) * 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(percent))\nsummary_primary_diag <- D %>% \n  group_by(primary_diag) %>%\n  summarise(count = n(), percent = n() / nrow(D) * 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(percent))\nsummary_readmitted <- D %>% \n  group_by(readmitted) %>%\n  summarise(count = n(), percent = n() / nrow(D) * 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(percent))\nsummary_change <- D %>% \n  group_by(change) %>%\n  summarise(count = n(), percent = n() / nrow(D) * 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(percent))\nsummary_diabetesMed <- D %>% \n  group_by(diabetesMed) %>%\n  summarise(count = n(), percent = n() / nrow(D) * 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(percent))\n\n# summary_primary_diag %>% kable(digits = 1, format.args = list(big.mark = \",\"), caption = \"Summary of primary diagnosis\")\n# summary_a1c %>% kable(digits = 1, format.args = list(big.mark = \",\"), caption = \"Summary of A1c test\")\n# summary_diabetesMed %>% kable(digits = 1, format.args = list(big.mark = \",\"), caption = \"Summary of diabetes medication\")\n# summary_readmitted %>% kable(digits = 1, format.args = list(big.mark = \",\"), caption = \"Summary of early readmission\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\ndf <- summary_primary_diag\ndf <- df %>% mutate(\n  label = c(paste(round(df$percent[1:5]), \"%\", sep = \"\"), rep(NA, nrow(df) -

While the visuals above could easily have been rendered as **pie charts**, I opted instead for a **circular bar plot**. Even though we’re still showing proportions, I find circular bars more intuitive when trying to understand actual contribution, both absolute and relative. For instance, only 17% of the 100,000 patients in our sample received an HbA1c measurement — fewer than 20,000 individuals. In the circular bar chart, this is immediately clear: not only is the arc labeled just under 20,000, but the smaller sweep of the 17% segment stands in stark visual contrast to the much larger group that did not receive the test. A standard pie chart, by comparison, flattens this distinction — visually and cognitively — making it harder to grasp the disparity at a glance.*\n\n*See our supplemental post to understand the plotting mechanics in detail.*\n\n***\\[Copilot was not used for these charts\\]***\n:::\n\n## 3. A closer look at all diabetes medications\n\nLet’s now take a closer look at the 23 medication prescriptions, each defined by whether a particular medication was prescribed to the patient, including well-known drugs like insulin and metformin.\n\nEach of these 23 fields is originally categorized into four groups or levels – $Down$, $Up$, $Steady$, $No$. We will visualize this data to assess variations across medications, first to explore how they're being prescribed, evaluating the use of Copilot in the plots we use, and then in relation to our two key covariates.\n\nTo facilitate this, we will first reshape the data using `gather()`, allowing us to analyze all 23 medications simultaneously. We will then create a series of visualizations using `dplyr` and `ggplot2`, with assistance from Copilot for fine-tuning our visuals.\n\n### 3.1. How are these medications being prescribed?\n\nTo visualize and understand how these are prescribed, after reshaping the data, we use `geom_tile()` to plot all 23 medications and their four levels each, leveraging the structure of the reshaped data. See our supplemental AI tools post to learn more about how this plot was designed.\n\n:::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"65%\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/Chunk31-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.column width=\"35%\"}\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Quick Insight\"}\n*We see that most medications are rarely prescribed; in fact, the medications commonly known for diabetes are the ones most given – insulin and metformin.

Note that [research](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4657617/)\\*\\* has shown that the HbA1c is important in \"tailoring appropriate diabetes therapy regimens\", so this finding of a differential dosage adjustment based on HbA1c measurement is extremely important.*\n:::\n::::\n::::::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\n# ii) A1c\n\n# Re-shape data\nmeds_a1c <- D %>%\n  select(meds_5pct$medication, a1c) %>%\n  gather(key = \"medication\", value = \"value\", -a1c) %>%\n  group_by(a1c, medication, value) %>% summarise(n=n()) %>% mutate(pct = (n / sum(n))*100)\n\n# Visualize with fine-tuned color parameters \nggplot(meds_a1c, aes(x = value, y = medication, fill = pct)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  facet_grid(~ a1c) +\n  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = palette.colors(9), \n                       limits = c(0, 100)) +\n  labs(title = \"Medication by the A1c test & tuned colors\",\n       x = \"Medication value\",\n       y = \"Medication name\", fill=\"Percent prescribed\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  geom_text(aes(label = paste(round(pct, 1), \"%\", sep=\"\")), color = \"white\", size = 4) +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 4. Conclusion and what's next\n\nThese findings highlight meaningful variation in both insulin administration and dosage adjustment across patient groups. While insulin is routinely given to diabetic patients, it is prescribed far less frequently for those with high-risk circulatory or respiratory conditions — and even less likely to be adjusted when given. Notably, patients who receive an HbA1c measurement are not only more likely to be prescribed insulin, but also more likely to have their dosage adjusted — a pattern aligned with clinical guidance emphasizing the role of HbA1c in tailoring diabetes treatment.\n\nTaken together, these patterns suggest that diagnostic practices and comorbid conditions meaningfully shape treatment decisions. With these foundational relationships established, we are now ready to explore how factors like HbA1c measurement and primary diagnosis influence downstream outcomes such as early readmission — a metric of both clinical quality and financial strain. Reducing preventable readmissions not only helps relieve the cost burden on the healthcare system but also improves the patient experience — making this a priority for administrators, caregivers, and, most importantly, the patients themselves. Leveraging AI-assisted pattern discovery, we can now surface deeper insights into how inpatient care decisions translate into longer-term outcomes, guiding more equitable and effective interventions across the board.\n\n> *In the meantime, be sure to check out this supplemental **post** we will publish shortly after this one on how we used Copilot in this post, including guidance on effective prompt writing for Copilt, and additional visualizations of the complex data we’re exploring!*\n\n## About the Author\n\n*Vidisha writes: \"I am a statistician and data science professional.
