In our previous post, [Examining Meta Analysis](https://rworks.dev/posts/meta-analysis/) we contrasted a frequentist version of a meta analysis conducted with R's [meta](https://cran.r-project.org/package=meta) package with a Bayesian meta analysis done mostly in [stan](https://mc-stan.org/) using `R's` [rstan](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rstan) package as a front end. We did this to hint at the difference between working within the restricted confines of a traditional frequentist framework and the amazing freedom to set up and solve complex probabilistic models using a modern Bayesian engine like `stan`. However, we fully acknowledge the cognitive burden of learning a completely new language and at the same time also learning Bayesian methods.

In this post, we will ease your anxiety by pointing to a middle way, by using the well established and powerful package `brms`^1 to formulate `stan` models.

## Set Up

First we set up our environment and read in the data on the effect of Amlodipine on angina patients which can be found in the `meta' package.
```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
library(tidyverse)
library(brms)
library(tidybayes)
library(ggdist)

```


nE is the number of subjects in the treatment arm for each Protocol, meanE is sample treatment mean that was calculated for each protocol, varE is the observed sample variance for each protocol and nC, meanC, and varC are the statistics for the control arm. (Note we will refer to Protocol as study from now on.)

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
angina <- read_csv(file = "Amlodipine.csv", col_types = c("c",rep(c("i","d","d"),2))) 

angina 
```

## Review The Model

As in the previous post, we will measure the effect of the amlodipine treatment by looking at the difference in the observed means from the two arms of the study. Our model can be expressed as :

$$\delta_i = \theta + \nu_i + \epsilon$$ where for each study, i, $\delta_i$, the observed treatment effect, is the mean of the control arm subtracted from the mean of the treatment arm.

$$\theta_i = \theta_{Ei} - \theta_{Ci}$$ $$ \theta_i \sim N(\theta, \tau)$$

$\nu_i$ is the group effect from each study

$$ \nu_i \sim N\left( \theta_i, \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{Ei}^2}{n_{Ei}}+\frac{\sigma_{Ci}^2}{n_{Ci}}} \right)$$

and $\epsilon_i$ is random noise:

$$\epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma)$$.

The data include $\hat\theta_E$ = meanE and $\hat\sigma^2_E$ = varE and the corresponding parameters for the control arm.

With this we have that $\theta$ is distributed as:

$$ \delta_i \sim N\left(\theta +\theta_i \;,\; \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_E^2}{n_E} + \frac{\sigma_C^2}{n_C}} + \sigma\right)$$

## brms Syntax

Although it is much simpler than using `stan` directly, `brms` is not without its own cognitive load. Any complex 'R' package, or for that matter, any sophisticated function written in an language you like requires taking time to understand how it works in order to use it confidently and correctly. At a minimum, it is necessary to fully comprehend the function signature and all of the options implicitly coded therein.

A good bit of the cognitive load associated with `brms` is associated with the formula interface which it adopts form the [`lme4`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lme4) package for formulating and solving frequentist mixed-effects models. `brms` builds on this syntax to allow formulating expressions to set up complex, multilevel models.

The general formula argument^2 is structured as *response* | *aterms* ~ *pterms* + (*gterms* | *group*). Everything on the right side of ∼ specifies predictors. `+` is used to separate different effects from each other. Note: the formula syntax is a very compressed notation, so even though it itself is concise explanations of it tend to be long. We have to leave this to the package documentation.

### aterms

The *aterms* are optional terms that provide special information about the response variable. Especially helpful for meta-analysis the term `se` specifies the standard errors of the response variable when response is a treatment effect. The pdf states:

> Suppose that the variable yi contains the effect sizes from the studies and sei the corresponding standard errors. Then, fixed and random effects meta-analyses can be conducted using the formulas yi | se(sei) ~ 1 and yi | se(sei) ~ 1 + (1 | study), respectively, where study is a variable uniquely identifying every study. ... By default, the standard errors replace the parameter sigma. To model sigma in addition to the known standard errors, set argument sigma in function se to TRUE, for instance, yi | se(sei, sigma = TRUE) ~ 1.

### pterms

`pterms` are population level terms. Everything on the right side of formula that is not recognized as part of a group-level term is treated as a population-level effect.

### gterms

`gterms` are group level terms that are specified as (coefs | group) where coefs contains one or more variables whose effects are assumed to vary with the levels of the grouping factor. For example, if both a group intercept and subject age vary by group, the group effects would be specified by (1 + age | group). Note that it is possible to specify multiple grouping factors each with multiple group-level coefficients.

## Set up the model using the brms package

First we read in the data using `dplyr` , add `delta_i` the difference in means and its standard error, `se_di`, rename Protocol to study for convenience, and drop the variables we no longer need.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
df <- angina %>% mutate(delta_i = (meanE - meanC), se_di = sqrt(varE/nE + varC/nC)) %>%
                rename(study = Protocol) %>%
                select(study, delta_i, se_di, nE,nC)
                        
head(df)
```

## Fit the model

Note that we are using the *aterm* `se` to inform the `brm()` function about varE and varC. The `sigma` = TRUE flag indicates that the residual standard deviation parameter sigma should be included in addition to the known measurement error. See the epsilon term in the model equations above. `prior` is an alias for the `set_prior()` function\^2.

The last two lines in the call to `brm()` specify that the model is to be fitted using 4 chains, each with 2000 iterations of which the first 1000 are warm up to calibrate the sampler. This provides a total of 4000 posterior samples.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

## Random effects meta-analysis

fit_brms <- brm(
  # specify random standard error effect size by group. See p43 of pdf 
  # sigma = TRUS means estimate epsilon variation in addition to using standard error estimates from data
  delta_i | se(se_di, sigma = TRUE) ~ 1 + (1 | study),
  data = df, 
  # set priors in stan language
  prior = c(prior(normal(0, 1), class = Intercept), 
           prior(normal(0, 1), class = sd, group = study)),
           iter = 2000, warmup = 1000, cores = 4, chains = 4, seed = 14,
           control = list(adapt_delta = 0.95))
```

The model fit function shows the great advantage `brms` achieves by combining `lme4`s concise formula notation with the exact solutions provided by `stan`. Working directly in `stan` does provide great freedom, but freedom comes at the cost of easily specifying models that might not make sense. The `brms`notation helps to guide users into specifying meaningful models.

Also note that in most cases, it is not necessary it is not necessary to specify Normal or t-distribution priors. The software will get it right. We included the prior statement to show how it works.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
# Save an object to a file
saveRDS(fit_brms, file = "fit_brms.rds")
```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
# Restore the object
fit_brms <- readRDS(file = "fit_brms.rds")

```

Here are the results of the model fit.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
summary(fit_brms)
```

The first section of the summary gives some basic information about the model specification. Following this are the statistics for each of the estimated parameters. We see that they are in substantial agreement with the results obtained in our previous post, even though some of the details of the model specification are slightly different than the previous model fits. The payoff is the Intercept whose value is 0.16.

For each estimated parameter *Estimate* and *Est.Error* provide the mean and the standard deviation of the posterior distribution. *l-95% CI* and *u-95% CI* provide the lower and upper bounds on the 95% credible intervals. *Rhat* = 1 for each parameter, indicating that the Markov chains have converged. An *Rhat* considerably greater than 1 (i.e., \> 1.1) would mean that the chains have not yet converged, and it would be necessary to run more iterations or perhaps set stronger priors. (See Gelman and Rubin) *Bulk_ESS* and *Tail_ESS* are diagnostics for the sampling efficiency in the bulk and tail of the posterior distribution respectively. See the [stan documentation](https://mc-stan.org/posterior/reference/ess_bulk.html) for details and interpretation.

The `brms` package also provides a plot method that plots posterity density and trace plots of the MCMC draws for the estimated statistics. Note that *b_Intercept* is the internal `stan` name for the population intercept.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
plot(fit_brms)
```

## Plots for analysis

Now we will prepare a Bayesian version of a *forest plot* with the help of the `spread_draws()` function in the `tidybayes` package that collects information from the `fit_brms` object and returns it as columns in a data frame. This first code block creates two data frames `out_indiv` adds the population to the study specific intercept for each draw, while `out_theta` sets up the data to compute the mean value of population intercept. These data frames are combined into `out_all` which is ready for plotting. The `mean_qi()` function from `tidybayes` translates draws from distributions in a the grouped data frame into point and interval summaries.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
# Prepare data frame for plotting
out_indiv <- spread_draws(fit_brms, r_study[study,term], b_Intercept) %>%
             mutate(Intercept = r_study + b_Intercept) %>%
             mutate(study = as.character(study)) %>%
             select(study,term,Intercept)
 
out_theta <- spread_draws(fit_brms, r_study[study,term], b_Intercept) %>%
           mutate(study = "theta") %>%
           mutate(Intercept = b_Intercept) %>%
           select(study,term,Intercept)

out_all <- bind_rows(out_indiv, out_theta) %>% mutate(study = factor(study)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(study = str_replace_all(study, "\\.", " "))

# Data frame of summary numbers
out_all_sum <- group_by(out_all, study) %>%  mean_qi(Intercept) 

```

This code stacks and plots the graphs of the labels.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
# Draw plot
out_all %>%   
  ggplot(aes(Intercept,study)) + 
  # Zero!
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linewidth = .25, lty = 2) +
  stat_halfeye(.width = c(.8, .95), fill = "dodgerblue") +
  # Add text labels
  geom_text(
    data = mutate_if(out_all_sum, is.numeric, round, 2),
    aes(label = str_glue("{Intercept} [{.lower}, {.upper}]"), x = 0.75),
    hjust = "inward"
  ) +
  # Observed as empty points
  geom_point(
    data = df %>% mutate(study = str_replace_all(study, "\\.", " ")), 
    aes(x=delta_i), position = position_nudge(y = -.2), shape = 1 
  ) 



```

## Stan Code

Finally, we extract the stan code from the `fit_brms` object. This is an extremely useful feature for checking the model, checking that your `brms` code is doing what you think it is, and maybe for learning `stan`.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
stancode(fit_brms)
```

<details>
<summary>"stan code"</summary>
```{r}
stancode(fit_brms)
```
</details>

## Conclusion and Observations

There are two "take aways" from this post that we would like to emphasize.

1.  `brms` makes it easy to specify Bayesian models that produce probability distribution that fully characterize estimated quantities. There is really no reason to settle for the frequentist point estimates that the norm before the availability of MCMC engines like `stan`.

2.  In Bayesian analysis we use the fact assumption that unidentified population parameters generate individual outcomes and in turn summaries of these individuals. This means knowing the individuals (or in our case sufficient statistics about the individuals) greatly influences our posterior estimates of plausible population parameters. With `brms` we are able to quickly infer the difference between treatment and control in a disciplined and documented fashion.

We would also like to point out that our simple example which is a typical meta-analysis project is a multi-level model that looks quite different from the kind of multi-level model one might encounter. If we had the patient level data from the amplodipine study then we might have considered a three level nested model: subjects within treatment arms within studies. We avoided the first level by not having the data and the second level by directly modeling the difference between treatment arms.
