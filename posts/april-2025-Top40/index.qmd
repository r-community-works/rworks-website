## Artificial Intelligence

[pangoling](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pangoling) v1.0.3: Provides access to word predictability estimates using large language models (LLMs) based on *transformer* architectures via integration with the [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) ecosystem. The package interfaces with pre-trained neural networks and supports both causal/auto-regressive LLMs (e.g., 'GPT-2') and masked/bidirectional LLMs (e.g., 'BERT') to compute the probability of words, phrases, or tokens given their linguistic context. For details on GPT-2 and causal models, see [Radford et al. (2019)](https://storage.prod.researchhub.com/uploads/papers/2020/06/01/language-models.pdf). For details on [BERT and masked models], see [Devlin et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805). There are four vignettes including [Using BERT](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pangoling/vignettes/intro-bert.html) and [Using GPT2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pangoling/vignettes/intro-gpt2.html).

## Chemistry

[PhotoGEA](https://cran.r-project.org/package=PhotoGEA) v1.3.2: Provides functions to read, process, fit, and analyze photosynthetic gas exchange measurements. See Lochocki, Salesse-Smith, & McGrath (2025)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pce.15501) for background and the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PhotoGEA/vignettes/PhotoGEA.html) to get started..

## Genomics

[HTGM2D](https://cran.r-project.org/package=HTGM2D) v1.1: Provides a two-dimensional heat map to be used with [GoMiner](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2003-4-4-r28) for the ontological analysis of microarray and proteomics studies that leverage the the Gene Ontology Consortium [GO](https://geneontology.org/) resource. The heat map reflects the Jaccard metric p-value for the number of genes in common for each corresponding pair. See the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/HTGM2D/vignettes/HTGM2D.html).

(2010)](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v033i09)). There are seven vignettes including an [Introduction](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MCSimMod/vignettes/quickstart.html) and [A Model of Newton's Law of Cooling](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MCSimMod/vignettes/newt_cool_demo.html).

[riemtan](https://cran.r-project.org/package=riemtan) v0.1.0: Implements various Riemannian metrics for symmetric positive definite matrices, including AIRM (Affine Invariant Riemannian Metric, see [Pennec et al. (2006)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-005-3222-z); Log-Euclidean, see [Arsigny et al. (2006)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.20965); Euclidean; Log-Cholesky. [see Lin (2019)](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/18M1221084); and Bures-Wasserstein metrics, see [Bhatia et al(2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0723086918300021?via%3Dihub). It also provides functions for computing logarithmic and exponential maps, vectorization, and statistical operations on the manifold of positive definite matrices. See the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/riemtan/vignettes/riemtan.html)


## Medicine

[NHSRwaitinglist](https://cran.r-project.org/package=NHSRwaitinglist) v0.1.1: Provides queueing theory functions to assist with waiting list management based on the approach described in [Fong et al. (2022)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.23.22279117v1). There are three vignettes including [Three example waiting lists](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NHSRwaitinglist/vignettes/three_example_waiting_lists.html) and [Exploring with Simulation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NHSRwaitinglist/vignettes/waiting_list_sim.html).

## Statistics

[ctsmTMB](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ctsmTMB) v1.0.0: Provides an interface for defining and fitting continuous-time state space models built with the `R6` ctsmTMB class. Available inter inference methods include Kalman filters and a Laplace approximation-based smoothing method. For details on the methods see the [documentation](https://ctsm.info/ctsmr-reference.pdf)) for  the `CTSMR` package and [Thygesen (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21358). There are six vignettes including a [Getting Started](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ctsmTMB/vignettes/ctsmTMB.html) guide and [Moment Predictions](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ctsmTMB/vignettes/predict.html).

[fitdistcp](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fitdistcp) v0.1.1: Provides functions to generate predictive distributions based on calibrating priors for various commonly used statistical models, including models with predictors. Functions are provided for densities, probabilities, quantiles, random deviates and the parameter posterior. Predictions are generated from the Bayesian prediction integral, with priors chosen to give good reliability (also known as calibration). See [Jewson et al.
