## 1. Introduction and recap

Healthcare analytics offers significant benefits to a wide range of stakeholders, including health administrators, organizations, but most importantly, doctors, nurses and health care workers.

In the first [part](https://rworks.dev/posts/healthcare-part1/) of this series, we introduced a complex dataset of diabetes patient encounters, comprising 100,000+ rows and over 50 columns. This dataset includes a rich array of variables, such as admission type and primary diagnosis. We demonstrated the process of cleaning, redefining, and preparing this data for analysis, highlighting the use of GitHub Copilot to navigate a particularly challenging variable.

In this second installment, we will dive deeper to evaluate the effectiveness of healthcare delivery, and the impact of patient-level variables on downstream outcomes. We start with exploring medication prescriptions more closely, and setting up the analytics around patient outcomes like hospital readmissions, the analysis of which we will see more of in the next post.

Finally, in a supplemental post, we will also examine the use of Copilot a little more, especially around avoiding tricky situations arising from insufficient context or guidance provided to Copilot (see here for [more](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/tools/copilot.html)).

## 2. Some useful data summaries

Before we explore how downstream outcomes, such as early hospital readmissions, may be influenced by specific care delivery actions, such as whether a patient’s HbA1c was measured during their stay, let’s ground ourselves in the dataset. We’ll start by summarizing key variables, which include:

-   **Covariates** — such as initial diagnoses and early interventions upon admission.

-   **Outcomes** — both intermediate care delivery results and downstream events, like early readmissions.

Understanding the structure and distribution of these variables is a critical first step before modeling or drawing any conclusions.

Let's read in the data again and clean it.  The code [snippet](https://github.com/VidishaVac/healthcare-analytics/blob/main/cleanDiabetic_data.R) and the data can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/VidishaVac/healthcare-analytics/tree/main/dataset_diabetes). We will summarize the following fields, and instead of tables, we will use some compelling visuals to rapidly get us to our insights.

| Field name | Field type | Field description |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| `primary_diag` | initial admission covariate | primary diagnosis upon admission |
| `a1c` | initial admission covariate | whether a patient was given the A1c test or not |
| `diabetesMed` | intermediate response | whether a patient was given any diabetes medication |
| `acarbose:troglitazone` | intermediate response\*\* | individual 23 diabetes medications that were prescribed or not, and if prescribed, were held steady, increased or decreased |
| `readmitted` | final response | whether the patient was readmitted early (\<30 days) |

> *For as long as we have had data and charts, there has been a debate about whether pie charts are helpful. While the visuals above could easily have been rendered as **pie charts**, I opted instead for a **circular bar plot**. Even though we’re still showing proportions, I find circular bars more intuitive when trying to understand actual contribution, both absolute and relative. For instance, only 17% of the 100,000 patients in our sample received an HbA1c measurement — fewer than 20,000 individuals. In the circular bar chart, this is immediately clear: not only is the arc labeled just under 20,000, but the smaller sweep of the 17% segment stands in stark visual contrast to the much larger group that did not receive the test. A standard pie chart, by comparison, flattens this distinction — visually and cognitively — making it harder to grasp the disparity at a glance.*

## 3. A closer look at all diabetes medications

Let’s now take a closer look at the 23 medication prescriptions, each defined by whether a particular medication was prescribed to the patient, including well-known drugs like insulin and metformin.

Each of these 23 fields is originally categorized into four groups or levels – $Down$, $Up$, $Steady$, $No$. We will visualize this data to assess variations across medications, first to explore how they're being prescribed, evaluating the use of Copilot in the plots we use, and then in relation to our two key covariates.

To facilitate this, we will first reshape the data using `gather`, allowing us to analyze all 23 medications simultaneously. We will then create a series of visualizations using `dplyr` and `ggplot2`, with assistance from Copilot for fine-tuning our visuals.

### 3.1. How are these medications being prescribed?

To visualize and understand how these are prescribed, after re-shaping the data, we use `geom_tile()` to plot all 23 medications and their 4 levels each, leveraging the structure of the re-shaped data. See our supplemental AI tools post to learn more about how this plot was designed.

It is worth noting here that it was upon switching to a heatmap style plot using `geom_tile()`, the more nuanced variations in medications become more evident. This is exactly the value of this tile plot - since in the next section, we will see its ability to handle a complex data structure (23 medications and their 4-fold values), triangulated over A1c test decisions and primary diagnoses, take in our inputs (both the aesthetic specifications as well as the suitable color palettes we provided), and excavate rapid insights into these kind of care delivery patterns.

### 3.2. Medication usage by 2 key covariates

Now, let's use the above plot style to triangulate and add more nuance to our investigation – that is, examine the impact made by the admitting primary diagnosis of the patient and whether their HbA1c was measured, on the diabetes medications given to the patient.

#### 3.2.1. Primary diagnoses

*While 64% of patients whose HbA1c is measured are given insulin, for only 52% of those who did not get an HbA1c measurement get this crucial medication. Though this disparity is much less for other medications, the tendency to adjust dosage is higher for patients with an HbA1c measurement. Note that [research](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4657617/)\*\* has shown that the HbA1c is important in "tailoring appropriate diabetes therapy regimens", so this finding of a differential dosage adjustment based on HbA1c measurement is extremely important.*

## 3. Conclusion and what's next

These findings highlight meaningful variation in both insulin administration and dosage adjustment across patient groups. While insulin is routinely given to diabetic patients, it is prescribed far less frequently for those with high-risk circulatory or respiratory conditions — and even less likely to be adjusted when given. Notably, patients who receive an HbA1c measurement are not only more likely to be prescribed insulin, but also more likely to have their dosage adjusted — a pattern aligned with clinical guidance emphasizing the role of HbA1c in tailoring diabetes treatment.

Taken together, these patterns suggest that diagnostic practices and comorbid conditions meaningfully shape treatment decisions. With these foundational relationships established, we are now ready to explore how factors like HbA1c measurement and primary diagnosis influence downstream outcomes such as early readmission — a metric of both clinical quality and financial strain. Reducing preventable readmissions not only helps relieve the cost burden on the healthcare system but also improves the patient experience — making this a priority for administrators, caregivers, and, most importantly, the patients themselves. Leveraging AI-assisted pattern discovery, we can now surface deeper insights into how inpatient care decisions translate into longer-term outcomes, guiding more equitable and effective interventions across the board.
