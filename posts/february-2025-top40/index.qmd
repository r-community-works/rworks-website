[gander](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gander) v0.1.0: Provides a *Copilot* completion experience that knows how to talk to the objects in your R environment. `ellmer` chats are integrated directly into your 'RStudio' and 'Positron' sessions, automatically incorporating relevant context from surrounding lines of code and your global environment. See the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gander/vignettes/gander.html) to get started.

[GitAI](https://cran.r-project.org/package=GitAI) v0.1.0: Provides functions to scan multiple `Git` repositories, pull specified files content and process it with large language models. You can summarize the content, extract information and data, or find answers to your questions about the repositories. The output can be stored in vector database and used for semantic search or as a part of a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) prompt. See the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GitAI/vignettes/building-shiny-app-chatbot.html.)

[rmcmc](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rmcmc) v0.1.1: Provides functions to simulate Markov chains using the Barker proposal (See [Livingstone and Zanella (2022)](https://academic.oup.com/jrsssb/article/84/2/496/7056132?login=false) ) to compute Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimates of expectations with respect to a target distribution on a real-valued vector space. The package also provides implementations of alternative proposal distributions, such as (Gaussian) random walk and Langevin proposals. Optionally, if [BridgeStan's R interface](https://roualdBridgeStan) `BridgeStan` can be used to specify the target distribution to sample from. There is an [Introduction](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rmcmc/vignettes/barker-proposal.html) to the Barker proposal and a vignette on [Adjusting the noise distribution](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rmcmc/vignettes/adjusting-noise-distribution.html).

## Mathematics

[flint](https://cran.r-project.org/package=flint) v0.0.3: Provides an interface to [`FLINT`](https://flintlib.org/), a C library for number theory which extends GNU [MPFR](https://www.mpfr.org/) and GNU [MP](https://gmplib.org/) with support for arithmetic in standard rings (the integers, the integers modulo n, the rational, p-adic, real, and complex numbers) as well as vectors, matrices, polynomials, and power series over rings and implements midpoint-radius interval arithmetic, in the real and complex numbers See [Johansson (2017)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7891956) for information on computation in arbitrary precision with rigorous propagation of errors see the [NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions](https://dlmf.nist.gov/) for information on additional capabilities. Look [here](https://github.com/jaganmn/flint) to get started.


## Machine Learning

[tall](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tall) v0.1.1: Implements a general-purpose tool for analyzing textual data as a `shiny` application with features that inccude comprehensive workflow, data cleaning, preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization. See the [vignette](https://www.k-synth.com/tall/).

![](tall.png){fig-alt="Automatic Lemmatization and PoS-Tagging through LLM

## Medicine

[BayesERtools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BayesERtools) v0.2.1: Provides auite of tools that facilitate exposure-response analysis using Bayesian methods. These include a streamlined workflow for fitting types of models that are commonly used in exposure-response analysis - linear and Emax for continuous endpoints, logistic linear and logistic Emax for binary endpoints, as well as performing simulation and visualization. Look [here](https://genentech.github.io/BayesERbook/) to learn more about the workflow and see the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BayesERtools/vignettes/overview_of_the_package.html) for an overview.

![](BayesER.png){fig-alt="Chart of supported model types"}


[PatientLevelPrediction](https://cran.r-project.org/package=PatientLevelPrediction) v6.4.0: Implements a framework to create patient level prediction models using the [Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model](https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/). Given a cohort of interest and an outcome of interest, the package can use data in the Common Data Model to build a large set of features which can then be used to fit a predictive model with a number of machine learning algorithms. This is further described in [Reps et al. (2017)](https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/25/8/969/4989437?login=false). There are fourteen vignettes including [Building Patient Level Prediction Models](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PatientLevelPrediction/vignettes/BuildingPredictiveModels.html) and [Best Practices]().

## Pharma


[SynergyLMM](https://cran.r-project.org/package=SynergyLMM) v1.0.1: Implements a framework for evaluating drug combination effects in preclinical in vivo studies which provides functions to analyze longitudinal tumor growth experiments using linear mixed-effects models, perform time-dependent analyses of synergy and antagonism, evaluate model diagnostics and performance, and assess both post-hoc and a priori statistical power.
