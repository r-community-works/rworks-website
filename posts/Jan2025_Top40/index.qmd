## Artificial Intelligence

[ellmer](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ellmer) v0.1.1: Integrates chat with large language models from a range of providers including [Claude](https://claude.ai>), [OpenAI](https://chatgpt.com), and more. Supports streaming, asynchronous calls, tool calling, and structured data extraction. There are five vignettes including [Getting Started](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ellmer/vignettes/ellmer.html) and [Prompt design](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ellmer/vignettes/prompt-design.html).


## Computational Methods

[zigg](https://cran.r-project.org/package=zigg) v0.0.2: Provides a lightweight interface to the `Ziggurat` pseudo-random number generator introduced by [Marsaglia and Tsang (2000)](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v005i08), and further improved by [Leong et al. (2005)](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v012i07) which can be used from R as well as from 'C/C++' code.  It is very fast for the normal, exponential, and uniform distributions. See [README](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zigg/readme/README.html) to get started.

## Genomics

[AntibodyForests](https://cran.r-project.org/package=AntibodyForests) v1.0.0: Provides tools to investigate and quantify inter- and intra-antibody repertoire evolution and explore wealth of immune repertoire sequencing data. See the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AntibodyForests/vignettes/AntibodyForests_vignette.html).

[geneviewer](https://cran.r-project.org/package=geneviewer) v0.1.10: Provides tools for plotting gene clusters and transcripts by importing data from GenBank, FASTA, and GFF files. It performs BLASTP and MUMmer alignments. See.[Altschul et al. (1990)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022283605803602?via%3Dihub) and [Delcher et al. (1999)](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/27/11/2369/1258501?login=false) for background and look [here](https://github.com/nvelden/geneviewer) to get started.

## Health Technology Assessment

[twig](https://cran.r-project.org/package=twig) v1.0.0.0: Provides tools for building decision and cost-effectiveness analysis models enabling users to write these models concisely, simulate outcomes—including probabilistic analyses—efficiently using optimized vectorized processes and parallel computing, and produce results. The package employs a Grammar of Modeling approach, inspired by the Grammar of Graphics, to streamline model construction. For an interactive graphical user interface, see [DecisionTwig](https://www.dashlab.ca/projects/decision_twig/). There are two vignettes: [Decision Tree Herpes Virus Encephalopathy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/twig/vignettes/decision_tree.htm)) and [Tutorial for Time Dependent Markov Model](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/twig/vignettes/markov_time_dep.html).

![](twig.png){fig-alt="Plot of decision tree"}

## Machine Learning

[bnns](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bnns) v0.1.2: Implements a formula-based interface for building and training Bayesian Neural Networks powered by `Stan`. Features include user chosen priors,  predictions, and support for regression, binary, and multi-class classification. See [Neal(1996)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4612-0745-0) for background and [README](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bnns/readme/README.html) to get started. 


## Medicine

[shinybody](https://cran.r-project.org/package=shinybody) v0.1.3: Provides an `htmlwidget` of the human body that allows displaying 79 different body parts. It works in Quarto documents, R Markdown documents, or any other HTML medium and also functions as an input/output widget in a `shiny` app. Look [here](https://github.com/robert-norberg/shinybody) to get started.

## Statistics

[flexFitR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=flexFitR) v1.1.0: Provides tools for flexible non-linear least squares model fitting using general-purpose optimization techniques. It supports a variety of optimization algorithms, including those provided by the `optimx` package and also supports parallel processing  via the `future` and `foreach` packages. Se [Nash and Varadhan (2011)](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v043i09) the details of the method supported. There are five vignettes including [How to start](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/flexFitR/vignettes/how_to_start.html) and [Modeling](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/flexFitR/vignettes/canopy-model.html).

![](flexFitR.png){fig-alt="Canopy Plot"}

[gsaot](https://cran.r-project.org/package=gsaot) v0.1.0: Provides functions to compute global sensitivity indices from given data using Optimal Transport, as defined in [Borgonovo et al (2024)](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01796). You provide an input sample, an output sample, decide the algorithm, and compute the indices. See the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gsaot/vignettes/gaussian-model-sensitivity.html).
