![](clusterv.gif){fig-alt="Plots comparing distortion" }

[cramR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cramR) v0.1.0: Implements *Cram*, a general approach to simultaneous learning and evaluation using a generic machine learning algorithm. In a single pass of batched data, Cram uses all of the data to repeatedly train a machine learning algorithm and tests its empirical performance.  A cramming process begins by randomly dividing a dataset into batches, and defining a baseline rule. Cram
trains an ML algorithm using the first batch of data, yielding an updated rule, and then
evaluate the performance difference between these two rules, i.e., ∆(Rule 1, Rule 0), using the
remaining T − 1 batches





Cram evaluates the final learned model directly, providing sharper inference aligned with real-world deployment. The method naturally applies to both policy learning and contextual bandits, where decisions are based on individual features to maximize outcomes. The package includes cram_policy() for learning and evaluating individualized binary treatment rules, cram_ml() to train and assess the population-level performance of machine learning models, and cram_bandit() for on-policy evaluation of contextual bandit algorithms. For all three functions, the package provides estimates of the average outcome that would result if the model were deployed, along with standard errors and confidence intervals for these estimates. Details of the method are described in Jia, Imai, and Li (2024) <https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/2403.07031v1_a83462e0-145b-4675-99d5-9754aa65d786.pdf> and Jia et al. (2025) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2403.07031>.


## Medicine

The method incorporates uncertainty in the delay timepoint through a truncated gamma prior and supports two-arm trial designs. See the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DTEBOP2/vignettes/DTEBOP2.htmlDTE).
