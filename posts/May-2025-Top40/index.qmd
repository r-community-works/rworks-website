## Computational Methods

[dspline](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dspline) v1.0.2: Provides tools for computations with discrete splines, a class of univariate piecewise polynomial functions which are analogous to splines, but for which smoothness is defined via divided differences rather than derivatives. Tools include discrete differentiation and integration, various matrix computations. See [Tibshirani (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03886) for the theory and [README](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dspline/readme/README.html) for an example.

![](dspline.png){fig-alt="Plot of discrete splines"}

[RANSAC](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RANSAC) v0.1.0: Provides functions to fit both linear and non-linear models using the RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus) algorithm, which is robust to outliers. See [Fischler & Bolles (1981)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/358669.358692) fora description of the algorithm and the [vignette]() for a a brief introducion.



[wex](https://cran.r-project.org/package=wex) v0.1.0: Provides functions to compute the exact observation weights for the Kalman filter and smoother, based on the method described in [Koopman and Harvey (2003)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165188902000611) and supports in-depth exploration of state-space models. See [README](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wex/readme/README.html) for examples.

## Data

[CardioDataSets](https://cran.r-project.org/package=CardioDataSets) v0.1.0: Offers a diverse collection of datasets focused on cardiovascular and heart disease research, including heart failure, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, transplant outcomes, cardiovascular risk factors, drug efficacy, and mortality trends. See the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CardioDataSets/vignettes/Introduction_to_CardioDataSets.html)


![](CardioDS.png){fig-alt="Distribution of Heart Diease by Age and Sex"}

[NeuroDataSets](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=NeuroDataSets) v0.1.0: Offers a diverse collection of datasets focused on the brain, nervous system, and related disorders including clinical, experimental, neuroimaging, behavioral, cognitive, and simulated data on conditions such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, epilepsy, schizophrenia, gliomas, and mental health. See the [Introduction](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NeuroDataSets/vignettes/introduction_to_neurodatasets.html).

## Decision Analysis

[aggreCAT](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/aggreCAT/vignettes/aggreCAT.pdf) v1.0.0:  Implements mathematical aggregation methods for structured data elicitation including those defined in [Hanea, A. et al. (2021)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0256919) to inform decision making. See the [Vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/aggreCAT/vignettes/aggreCAT.pdf).

![](aggreCAT.png){fig-alt="Diagram illustrating decision aggregation"}

## Ecology

[fireexposuR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fireexposuR) v1.1.0: Provides methods for computing and visualizing wildfire igntion exposure and directional vulnerability. See [Beverly et al. (2010)](https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/WF09071) and [Beverly and Forbes (2023)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11069-023-05885-3) for background and methodology and the [Introduction](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fireexposuR/vignettes/fireexposuR.html) to get started.
