## Computational Methods

[globpso](https://cran.r-project.org/package=globpso) v1.3.0: Implements a general purpose particle swarm optimization and differential evolution algorithm for solving optimization problems with nonlinear, non-differentiable, and multi-modal objective functions. See [Kennedy and Eberhart (1995)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/494215), [Sun et al. (2004)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1330875, and [Storn & Price (1997)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1008202821328) for the theory and [README](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/globpso/readme/README.html) to get started. 

## Data

[autodb](https://cran.r-project.org/package=autodb) v2.3.1: Provides tools to automatically normalize a data frame to [third normal form](clayringsmiletus) to facilitate data cleaning. Includes functions to discover approximate dependencies and plot the resulting "database" via [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/). See [README](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/autodb/vignettes/autodb.html) for documentation.

[maths.genealogy](https://cran.r-project.org/package=maths.genealogy) v0.1.2: Provides functions to query, extract, and plot genealogical data from [The Mathematics Genealogy Project](https://mathgenealogy.org/). Data is gathered from the WebSocket server run by the [geneagrapher-core](ttps://github.com/davidalber/geneagrapher-core) project. See the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maths.genealogy/vignettes/getting-started.html) to get started.
