This post is a first look at [Nixtla's](https://docs.nixtla.io/) `TimeGPT` generative, pre-trained transformer for time series forecasting using the `nixtlar` R package.

As described in [Garza et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04052), TimeGPT is a Transformer-based time series model with self-attention mechanisms. The architecture comprises an encoder-decoder structure with multiple layers, each with residual connections and layer normalization. The encoder, a stack of multi-head self-attention layers followed by a feed-forward neural network, processes the input time series. The decoder, which is similar to the encoder, generates the forecast. The decoder includes an additional multi-head attention layer that takes the encoder’s output as input. The model is trained using a teacher-forcing strategy, where the decoder receives the ground-truth values during training. The model is then used for forecasting by feeding the model’s predictions back as input during inference.

Nixtla's website provides a considerable amount of explanatory material, documentation, and code examples in Python. The [`nixtlar`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=nixtlar) package wraps the Python code to provide an R interface. The package documentation for version 0.6.2 doesn't fully the R functions, but the vignettes provide sufficient code examples to get started.

*Before getting started with TimeGPT, you will have to register for an API key. The process is easy enough and is described in this [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nixtlar/vignettes/setting-up-your-api-key.html).*

## The Data

The electricity dataset included in the `nixtlar` package contains hourly observations of  electricity consumption generated sourced from the [PJM Interconnection LLC](https://www.pjm.com/), a regional transmission organization that is part of the Eastern Interconnection grid in the United States. There are five different time series with data taken from 2012 to 2018. 

Note that the electricity data is in "long" format and that `ds` the time variable is character data.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
df <- nixtlar::electricity
glimpse(df)
```

A look at the "wide" data frame shows that the various series do not cover the same time periods.
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
df_wide <- df |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = unique_id, values_from = y)

head(df_wide)
```

Plots indicate that all of the series show periods of considerable volatility. The BE, DE, and FR series appear to be stationary. NP trends upward to the right, and the PJM series appears to be nonlinear.
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
df2 <- df |> mutate(time = as.POSIXct(ds, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")) |>
  group_by(unique_id)

p <- df2 |> ggplot(aes(x = time, y = y, color = unique_id)) +
  geom_line() + facet_wrap( ~ unique_id, scales = "free")

p
```



## TimeGPT Forecsts

I'll begin by showing off the `nixtlar` forecasting function, which can handle multiple time series by forecasting eight hours ahead using all of the data. The parameter `h` specifies the number of steps ahead to forecast, and `level` specifies the confidence level for the forecast.

Here is the built-in `nixtlar` plot function.
```{r}
#| eval: false
#nixtla_client_plot(df, nixtla_client_fcst, max_insample_length = 200)
```


![](fcst.png){fig-alt=""}

This plot uses `ggplot2`to focus in on the forecasts of 8 points using all of the data. The level parameter indicates that both 80% and 96% confidence intervals should be computed.

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
# nixtla_client_fcst <- nixtla_client_forecast(df, h = 8, level = c(80,95))
# saveRDS(nixtla_client_fcst, "nixtla_client_fcst.rds")

nixtla_client_fcst <- readRDS("nixtla_client_fcst.rds")

ncf_df <-  nixtla_client_fcst |> mutate(time = as.POSIXct(ds, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")) |> group_by(unique_id)

names(ncf_df) <- c("unique_id", "ds", "TimeGPT", "lon", "loe", "hie", "hin")

pf <- ncf_df |> ggplot(aes(x = ds, y = TimeGPT, color = unique_id)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lon, ymax = hin),
              linetype = 2,
              alpha = 0.1) +
  facet_wrap( ~ unique_id, scales = "free")

pf
```


For the rest of this post, I'll work only with the BE data and do some simple back testing. I will split the data into a training set and a test set containing 24 hours worth of observations. Then, I'll fit established time series forecasting models and compare how well they do vis-a-vis the actual data and with each other. Note, I will not attempt any tuning of these models. This will make it a fair, "out-of-the-box" comparison.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
NF <- 24

BE_df_wide <- df |> pivot_wider(names_from = unique_id, values_from = y) |>
  select(ds, BE) |> drop_na()

BE_train_df <- BE_df_wide %>% filter(row_number() <= n() - NF)
BE_test_df <- tail(BE_df_wide, NF)
BE_train_df <- BE_train_df |> rename(y = BE) |> mutate(unique_id = "BE")
BE_test_df <- BE_test_df |> rename(y = BE)
```


The `nixtla_client_forecast()` function is the main `nixtlar` forecasting function. (I have already run this function and saved the results RDS file in order not to make an API call every time the code is run during the blog building process.) 

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#nixtla_fcst <- nixtla_client_forecast(BE_train_df, h = NF, level = 95)
#saveRDS(nixtla_fcst, "nixtla_fcst_24.rds")
nixtla_fcst <- readRDS("nixtla_fcst_24.rds")
names(nixtla_fcst) <- c("unique_id", "ds", "TimeGPT", "lo95", "up95")

```

Here, I create a data frame to hold the actual and forecast values.
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
fcst_df <- tail(nixtla_fcst, NF) |> select(ds, TimeGPT) |>
  rename(time = ds, tgpt_fcst = TimeGPT) |>
  mutate(elec_actual = BE_test_df$y)

head(fcst_df)
```

## Some Comparative Forecasts

This next section of code reformat the training data into a format that is suitable for the `auto.arima()` and `auto.ets()` functions. Both of these functions require that the data be expressed as a `ts()` object. The original version of this post expressed the time series data as an `xts()` object: an error that substantially impacted the ARIMA and exponential smoothing forecasts. 

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
auto_train <- BE_train_df |> select(-unique_id) |>
  mutate(time = as.POSIXct(ds, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")) |> select(-ds)

elec_ts <- ts(auto_train$y, start = c(2016, 10, 22, 0), frequency = 24)
```

### ARIMA Forecast with `auto.arima()`

The `auto.arima()` function from the `forecast` package fits a fairly sophisticated ARIMA(2,1,1)(1.0.1)[24] model. The parameters in parentheses means two autoregressive terms, one difference, one moving average term, one seasonal autoregressive term, no seasonal differencing, and one seasonal moving average term. [24] indicates that the seasonal pattern repeats every 24 observations. (Note that because the ARIMA forecast takes several seconds to run, I am reading form a an rds file to expedite the blog process.)

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#arima_fcst <- elec_ts |>
#  auto.arima() |>
#  forecast(h = NF , level = 95)
#saveRDS(arima_fcst, "arima_fcst_24.rds")
arima_fcst <- readRDS("arima_fcst_24.rds")
```



### Exponential Smoothing Forecast with `ets()`

Because I have provided no guidance, the `ets()` function from the `forecast` package fits an ETS(M,N,M) model. This is a multiplicative model without a trend component, where both the error and the seasonal components are multiplicative. The first M indicates that the error term (random fluctuation) is modeled as a multiplicative component where the error term's effect on the forecasted value is proportional to the level of the time series.
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
ets_fcst <- elec_ts |>
  ets() |>
  # number of periods to forecast
  forecast(h = NF)
```


### Prophet Forecast

I also ask the `prophet()` function from the `prophet` package for an automatic fit using the default parameters. Among other things, this means a linear growth curve with additive seasonality and automatic estimates for daily seasonality. As for the TimeGPT forecast, the model is fit using`BE_train_df` data frame in which the time variable is character data. The `make_future_dataframe()` function creates a data frame with the same structure as `BE_train_df` but with the `ds` column extended by `NF` periods.
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
prophet_fit <- prophet(BE_train_df)

future <- make_future_dataframe(
  prophet_fit,
  periods = NF,
  freq = 3600,
  include_history = FALSE
)

prophet_fcst <- predict(prophet_fit, future)
```



## Results and Discussion

Before plotting, let's have a look at the wide data frame that holds the forecasts.
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
fcst_df2 <- fcst_df |>
  mutate(
    arima_fcst = as.vector(arima_fcst$mean),
    ets_fcst = as.vector(ets_fcst$mean),
    prophet_fcst = prophet_fcst$yhat
  )

head(fcst_df2)
```

Then, shape the data into long format and plot.
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
#| classes: preview-image
fcst_dft2_long <- fcst_df2 %>%
  pivot_longer(!time, names_to = "method", values_to = "mean")

q <- fcst_dft2_long |>
  ggplot(aes(
    x = time,
    y = mean,
    group = method,
    color = method
  )) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("TimeGPT vs ARIMA vs ETS vs Prophet vs actual data - 24 Point Forecast")

q
```

The TimeGPT forecast looks quite good. I don't think this is a big surprise, given that the Nixtla folks chose the electricity data set to show off their transformer. However, it is curious, that except for one point, the TimeGPT forecast is lower than the actual data. It is also interesting that some of the forecasted points that are farther out are a better match to the actual data than the initial forecast points.

The ARIMA forecast is quite good. It tracks the first few points very closely,  undershoots the peaks of the actual data, but recovers after both peaks and tracks the data well towards the end of the forecast period. 

The exponential smoothing forecast mostly stays well below the actual data.

The "no thought" prophet model does a pretty good job, but it does seem to have overacted to the downward trends at the beginning and end of the forecast period. My guess is that with a little tuning prophet could do much better. 

It is also worth noting that choosing the *best* forecast also depends on your objectives. For example, in some circumstances, one might prefer  a forecast that reproduces seasonal patterns or representative volatility rather than overall accuracy. For this exercise, we see that TimeGPT mimics the volatility of the actual data but that the ARIMA forecast has the lowest rood mean squared error. Also note that the ARIMA and exponential smoothing forecasts are not quite *black-box* forecasts. Converting the data into `ts()` time series objects entails explicitly providing seasonality information. TimeGPT apparently inferred this information from character data.
 

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
#| warning: false
RMSE <-  function(m, o){sqrt(mean((m - o)^2))}
rms_names <- c("tgpt", "arima", "ets", "prophet")
rms_fcst <- array(NA_real_,
                          dim = 4,
                          dimnames = list(rms_names))
rms_fcst[1] <- RMSE(fcst_df2$tgpt_fcst, fcst_df2$elec_actual)
rms_fcst[2] <- RMSE(fcst_df2$arima_fcst, fcst_df2$elec_actual)
rms_fcst[3] <- RMSE(fcst_df2$ets_fcst, fcst_df2$elec_actual)
rms_fcst[4] <- RMSE(fcst_df2$prophet_fcst, fcst_df2$elec_actual)
rms_fcst
```

## Some Final Thoughts


It is clear that the TimeGPT model has upped the game for black-box time series forecasting. It is sure to become a powerful tool for doing exploratory work with large time series and comparing and contrasting multiple time series and may become the "go-to" baseline forecasting tool for a wide range of time series. Moreover, I expect that time series experts who can fine-tune prophet and more traditional time series models will be able to develop some intuition about what TimeGPT is doing by assessing its behavior in relation to these models. 

I am aware that this little post may have raised more questions than it answered. If so, please try your hand at elaborating on some of the issues raised. We would be very happy to consider your time series posts for publication on R Works.

Finally, for a more sophisticated analysis of these series that deals with their multiseasonality aspects, see the [Electricity Load Forecast Tutorial](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/statsforecast/docs/tutorials/electricityloadforecasting.html). And, for some ideas about how to harness "ordinary" LLMs for time series forecasting have a look at the second half of the talk that Bryan Lewis gave to [nyhackr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NM-nJxm-qY) in April 2024.

## Acknowledgment
Many thanks to Professor Rob Hyndman for flagging the error of incorrectly forming the time series object for the ARIMA and exponential smoothing forecasts. Any errors still remaining in this post are all mine.
