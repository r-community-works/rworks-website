### Computational Methods

[hmde](https://cran.r-project.org/package=hmde) v1.2.1: Implements a wrapper for `Stan` with built-in hierarchical Bayesian longitudinal model for repeat observation data. Model choice selects the differential equation that is fit to the observations. See [O'Brien et al. (2024)](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.14463) for the theory. There are six vignettes including [Constant Growth](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hmde/vignettes/constant-growth.html) and [hmde for Mathematicians](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hmde/vignettes/hmde_for_mathematicians.html).

[ironseed](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ironseed) v0.2.0: Implements a procedure for seeding R's built in random number generators using a variable-length sequence of values. The algorithm accumulates entropy into a 256-bit hash digest or "ironseed" and generates a variable-length sequence of output seeds. See the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ironseed/readme/README.html) for an overview.

[RBaM](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RBaM) v1.0.1: Implements an interface to the `BaM` (Bayesian Modeling) engine, a `Fortran` - based executable for Bayesian estimation with a particular focus on uncertainty quantification. See [Renard (2017)](https://hal.science/hal-02606929v1) for technical detaila and the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RBaM/readme/README.html) for examplesRBam

### Data

[getRad](https://cran.r-project.org/package=getRad) v0.2.0: Provides functions to load polar volume and vertical profile data from several sources in Europe and the US for aeroecological research. See the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/getRad/vignettes/supported_sources.html) and [GitHub page](https://aloftdata.github.io/getRad/) for examples.

### Epidemilogy

[rtestim](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rtestim) v1.0.0: Use trend filtering, a type of regularized nonparametric regression, to estimate the instantaneous reproduction number, Rt, which indicates how many new infections will result from each new infection today. See [Liu et al.(2024)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012324) for background. There is an [Introduction](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rtestim/vignettes/delay-distributions.html) and a vignette on [Delay Distributions](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rtestim/vignettes/delay-distributions.html).

![](rtestim.png){fig-alt="Plot of variants in circulation"}

### Mathematics

[inteq](https://cran.r-project.org/package=inteq) v1.0: Implements Matthew Thomas's *Python* library `inteq`. Solves Fredholm integral equations of the first kind ($f(s) = \int_a^b K(s, y) g(y) dy$) using methods described by [Twomey (1963)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/321150.321157). Solves Volterra integral equations of the first kind ($f(s) = \int_0^s K(s,y) g(t) dt$) using methods from [Betto and Thomas (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08496) Solves Voltera integral equations of the second kind ($g(s) = f(s) + \int_a^s K(s,y) g(y) dy$) using methods from [Linz (1969)](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/0706034). See the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/inteq/vignettes/documentation.html).


[topolow](https://cran.r-project.org/package=topolow) v2.0.0: Implements the Topolow algorithm to embed objects into a low-dimensional Euclidean space from a matrix of pairwise dissimilarities, even when the data do not satisfy metric or Euclidean axioms. The algorithm is particularly well-suited for sparse, incomplete, and censored (thresholded) datasets such as antigenic relationships. It  employs a likelihood-based approach to determine the optimal number of dimensions for the embedding/map, avoiding distortions common in methods with fixed low dimensions. See [Arhami & Rohani (2025a)](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/41/7/btaf372/8173949?login=false) for methods and mathematical proofs, [Arhami and Rohani (2025b)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01733) for embedding details, and the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/topolow/vignettes/Comprehensive_Evaluation.html) for an introduction.

### Medical Statistics

[GHRexplore](https://cran.r-project.org/package=GHRexplore) v0.1.1: Provides commonly used visualizations of temporal and spatio-temporal health data including case counts, incidence rates, and covariates including time series, heatmaps, seasonality plots, maps and more. See the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GHRexplore/vignettes/GHRexplore.html).

![](GHRexplore.png){fig-alt="Time series plot}"}




### Statistics



[GCEstim](https://cran.r-project.org/package=GCEstim) v0.1.0: Provides functions for regression estimation and inference using the Generalized Maximum Entropy (GME) and Generalized Cross Entropy (GCE) framework, a flexible method for solving ill-posed inverse problems and parameter estimation under uncertainty.
