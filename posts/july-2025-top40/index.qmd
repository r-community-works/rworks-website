It  employs a likelihood-based approach to determine the optimal number of dimensions for the embedding/map, avoiding distortions common in methods with fixed low dimensions. See [Arhami & Rohani (2025a)](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/41/7/btaf372/8173949?login=false) for methods and mathematical proofs, [Arhami and Rohani (2025b)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01733) for embedding details, and the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/topolow/vignettes/Comprehensive_Evaluation.html) for an introduction.
